Experimental evidence indicates that the confinement time results mainly from the turbulent transport of energy, the magnitude of which depends on the turbulent state resulting from nonlinear saturation mechanisms, in particular, the self-generation of coherent macroscopic structures and large scale flows. Plasma geometry has a strong impact on the structure and magnitude of these flows and also modifies the mode linear growth rates. Nonlinear global gyrokinetic simulations in realistic tokamak magnetohydrodynamic equilibria show how plasma shape can control the turbulent transport. Results are best described in terms of an effective temperature gradient. With increasing plasma elongation, the nonlinear critical effective gradient is not modified while the stiffness of transport is decreasing.},

The plasma configuration as well as the local normalized pressure (beta), collisionality (nu*), Mach number and the ratio of ion and electron temperature at the pedestal top were kept constant, while rho* was varied by a factor of four. The width of the steep gradient region of the electron temperature (T(e)) and density (n(e)) pedestals normalized to machine size showed no or only a weak trend with rho*. A rho(1/2) or rho(1) dependence of the pedestal width, given by some theoretical predictions, is not supported by the current experiments. This is encouraging for the pedestal scaling towards ITER as it operates at lower rho* than existing devices. Some differences in pedestal structure and ELM behaviour were, however, found between the devices; in the DIII-D discharges, the n(e) and T(e) pedestal were aligned at high rho* but the ne pedestal shifted outwards in radius relative to T(e) as rho* decreases, while on JET the profiles remained aligned while rho* was scanned by a factor of two. The energy loss at an ELM normalized to the pedestal energy increased from 10% to 40% as rho* increased by a factor of two in the DIII-D discharges but no such variation was observed in the case of JET. The measured pedestal pressures and widths were found to be consistent with the predictions from modelling based on peeling-ballooning stability theory, and are used to make projections towards ITER},

   abstract = {A collisionality scaling experiment associating a confinement analysis, turbulence measurements across the whole plasma and gyrokinetic modelling is reported. In Tore Supra L-mode plasmas, mid-radius dimensionless collisionality nu* has been varied performing a four-points scan from similar or equal to 0.1 to similar or equal to 0.7. The normalized confinement time exhibits a dependence with respect to collisionality: B tau(E) proportional to nu*(-0.3 +/- 0.3) which is strongly modified when accounting for the confinement dependence on the normalized Larmor radius, rho*, and normalized pressure, beta, since one obtains B tau(E) proportional to nu*(0.0 +/- 0.7). This weak dependence is consistent with ITER L mode scaling laws and dedicated experiments elsewhere (Luce 2008 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 50 043001). The global analysis is confirmed by normalized effective heat transport coefficients which do not vary outside their error bars in a limited radial range of reliability. The analysis is completed by density fluctuation delta n(e)/n(e) measurements across the whole plasmas. For normalized radius r/a < 0.7, delta n(e)/n(e) does not depart from its error bars and the radial wave-vector spectra are not modified. These observations are well reproduced by non-linear gyrokinetic simulations, where, despite high nu* values, no zonal flow damping mechanism is at play. At the plasma edge (r/a > 0.7), the lowest poloidal wave-vector measured by the Doppler reflectometer exhibits a decrease in delta n(e)/n(e) with increasing nu*, while the other turbulence measurements remain unaffected.},

Nonlinear gyrokinetic electromagnetic simulations for all species are still too costly in terms of computing time. On the other hand, interestingly, the quasi-linear approximation seems to retain the relevant physics for fairly reproducing both experimental results and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Quasi-linear fluxes are made of two parts: (1) the quasi-linear response of the transported quantities and (2) the saturated fluctuating electrostatic potential. The first one is shown to follow well nonlinear numerical predictions; the second one is based on both nonlinear simulations and turbulence measurements. The resulting quasi-linear fluxes computed by QuaLiKiz (Bourdelle et al 2007 Phys. Plasmas 14 112501) are shown to agree with the nonlinear predictions when varying various dimensionless parameters, such as the temperature gradients, the ion to electron temperature ratio, the dimensionless collisionality, the effective charge and ranging from ion temperature gradient to trapped electron modes turbulence.},

   abstract = {Comparisons between time dependent simulations and experiments in ion cyclotron heated plasmas in the JET tokamak have been done. The heating is simulated with a time dependent code, PION-T. The scenario which has been analyzed is minority heating of hydrogen at the fundamental cyclotron resonance in a deuterium majority plasma. Both second harmonic deuterium heating and fundamental hydrogen cyclotron heating take place. For large power, anisotropic high energy tails will be formed on the velocity distribution of the resonating ion species. The formation of such a tail on the deuterium is assessed by monitoring the 2.4 MeV neutron flux from (D,D) reactions. By taking the difference between two different plasma energy measurements, which put different weights on the parallel and perpendicular energy, the anisotropic energy content can be measured. This is compared with that calculated for hydrogen and deuterium. For low power levels or at the beginning of the heating pulse good agreement between calculations and measurements is found supporting that the power deposition is correctly described and that the fast ions, responsible for the anisotropic energy, slow down by classical collisions. For large amounts of coupled power or later in the heating phase a clear difference between calculations and measurements is found. This discrepancy is identified, in the analyzed discharges, to be caused by finite orbit effects. By including the width of the drift orbits, good agreement between simulations and experiments is obtained also for the high power cases. Fast ions have earlier been seen to be expelled from the centre of the plasma in connection with sawtooth crashes. By studying the rapid changes in fast energy content in connection with sawtooth instabilities, the authors find the reduction to be consistent with that about 40% of the fast ions are expelled from the central region to the outside of the q=1 surface and that prompt losses are negligible},

The radial electric field is not affected by the ripple variation and remains well described by its neoclassical prediction.

This method can be used to calculate the neoclassical transport in a magnetic fusion device with a nonaxisymmetric magnetic field. When applied to a tokamak with ripple, it provides an efficient means to discriminate between various regimes, depending on collisionality and ripple amplitude. This technique provides a means to test simplified collision operators suitable for gyrokinetic codes. It is found that these operators need only satisfy modest requirements in order to recover the correct neoclassical equilibrium, at least in the large aspect ratio limit. Finally, it appears that the toroidal viscous damping rate due to ripple is usually not negligible, thus removing the degeneracy between the radial electric field and the toroidal velocity. 2010 American Institute of Physics.

   abstract = {This paper analyzes the properties of a two-field critical gradient model that couples a heat equation to an evolution equation for the turbulence intensity. It is shown that the dynamics of a perturbation is ballistic or diffusive depending on the shape of the pulse and also on the distance of the temperature gradient to the instability threshold. This dual character appears in the linear response of this model for a wave packet. It is recovered when investigating the nonlinear solutions of this system. Both self-similar diffusive fronts and ballistic fronts are shown to exist. When the propagation is ballistic, it is found that the front velocity is the geometric mean between the turbulent diffusion coefficient and a microinstability growth rate.

High time and space resolution measurements of the electron density reveal the existence of a flat profile region encompassing the q = 1 surface, on which is superimposed a density peak building up between sawtooth relaxations. For the first time in this regime, we have determined the underlying transport of both nickel and electrons independently of the effect of sawteeth in the central part of the plasma. Electron transport is consistent with the neoclassical expectations only in the close vicinity of the magnetic axis. Further out, it exceeds the neoclassical values as calculated with the NCLASS code, although the turbulence level is very low in the whole central region. In contrast, nickel transport is in good agreement with the neoclassical calculations in the same region. The neoclassical effect on trapped particles of a persisting mode due to incomplete reconnection of the magnetic surfaces is consistent with these observations.},

   abstract = {Experimental results on impurity transport in tokamaks are based on various techniques. We study here how the choice of the injection technique and of the analysis method influences the results. We have used three different injection techniques available in Tore Supra: laser blow-off, gas puff and supersonic molecular beam injection. We show that the long time duration of the gas puff injection compared with particle confinement time provides very limited information. The laser blow-off technique and supersonic pulsed injections give satisfactory results for diffusion but low quality convection estimates, presumably because the fast source term quenches the role of convection in the continuity equation. The best method is shown to be the combined analysis of supersonic pulsed injections and continuous puffing of a gaseous species. We obtain convection velocity profiles to an uncertainty of about 0.5 ms(-1). This method is applied to ohmic, weakly sawtoothing plasmas. The diffusion coefficient is independent of the impurity charge and the convection velocity is inward. Neoclassical calculations show that these plasmas are dominated by anomalous transport. Quasilinear gyrokinetic simulations are in qualitative agreement with the above experimental results. We deduce from the simulations that convection is dominated by the curvature term, which means that no charge dependence should be expected in this situation.},

Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] to obtain comprehensive multifield, multipoint, multiwavenumber fluctuation measurements and their scalings with key dimensionless parameters. The results of two representative validation studies are presented: an elongation scaling study performed in beam heated L-mode discharges and an electron heating power scan performed in quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) discharges. A 50% increase in the elongation kappa is observed to lead to a similar to 50% increase in energy confinement time se and accompanying decrease in fluctuation levels, qualitatively consistent with a priori theoretical predictions and nonlinear GYRO [J. Candy and R. E. Waltz, J. Comput. Phys. 186, 545 (2003)] simulations. However, these simulations exhibit clear quantitative differences from experiment in the predicted magnitudes and trends with radius of turbulent fluxes and fluctuation levels which cannot be fully accounted for by uncertainties due to transport stiffness. In the QH-mode study, local nonlinear GYRO simulations that neglect fast ion effects show a similar proportional response to the applied electron cyclotron heating as the experiment, but overpredict the magnitudes of transport and fluctuation levels by a factor of 10 or more. Possible sources of this overprediction, namely nonlocal effects and self-consistent fast beam ions, are identified and discussed. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3574518]},

In the simulation, initial saturation levels of the ETG mode are consistent with the mixing length theory, which shows a Bohm (gyro-Bohm) like rho*-scaling for a ballooning type (slab like) ETG mode in a positive (reversed) shear configuration, where rho* is the electron Larmor radius rho(te) divided by the minor radius a. In a realistic small rho* positive shear configuration, the ETG mode has a higher saturation level than the large rho* positive shear configuration and the reversed shear configuration. In the nonlinear turbulent state, the ETG turbulence in the positive and reversed shear configurations shows quite different structure formations. In the positive shear configuration, the ETG turbulence is dominated by streamers which have a ballooning type structure, and the electron temperature T, profile is quickly relaxed by enhanced heat transport in a turbulent time scale. In the reversed shear configuration, quasi-steady zonal flows are produced in the negative shear region, while the positive shear region is characterized by streamers. Accordingly, the electron thermal diffusivity X, has a gap structure across the q(min) surface, and the T-e gradient is sustained above the critical value for a long time. The results suggest a stiffness of the T-e profile in positive shear tokamaks and a possibility of the T-e transport barrier in reversed shear tokamaks.},

   abstract = {In order to prepare adequate current ramp-up and ramp-down scenarios for ITER, present experiments from various tokamaks have been analysed by means of integrated modelling in view of determining relevant heat transport models for these operation phases. A set of empirical heat transport models for L-mode (namely, the Bohm-gyroBohm model and scaling based models with a specific fixed radial shape and energy confinement time factors of H(96-L) = 0.6 or H(IPB98) = 0.4) has been validated on a multi-machine experimental dataset for predicting the l(i) dynamics within +/- 0.15 accuracy during current ramp-up and ramp-down phases. Simulations using the Coppi-Tang or GLF23 models (applied up to the LCFS) overestimate or underestimate the internal inductance beyond this accuracy (more than +/- 0.2 discrepancy in some cases). The most accurate heat transport models are then applied to projections to ITER current ramp-up, focusing on the baseline inductive scenario (main heating plateau current of I(p) = 15 MA). These projections include a sensitivity study to various assumptions of the simulation. While the heat transport model is at the heart of such simulations (because of the intrinsic dependence of the plasma resistivity on electron temperature, among other parameters), more comprehensive simulations are required to test all operational aspects of the current ramp-up and ramp-down phases of ITER scenarios. Recent examples of such simulations, involving coupled core transport codes, free-boundary equilibrium solvers and a poloidal field (PF) systems controller are also described, focusing on ITER current ramp-down.},

   pages = {2041-2065},
   abstract = {Waves at a frequency close to the lower hybrid (LH) resonance are widely used in tokamaks for non-inductive current drive. Modelling of LH waves is usually carried out by combining a Ray-tracing (RT) code for computing the LH waves propagation to a solver of the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation which calculates an electron distribution function self-consistently with the waves absorption. The DELPHINE code has been developed along this approach with accurate treatment, of the magnetic equilibrium and the fast electrons dynamics in momentum space. Using this code, the influence of the plasma current on the LH waves propagation and absorption is investigated in detail. High plasma current is found to broaden the absorbed LH spectrum towards high phase velocities, thus increasing the current drive efficiency of the waves. The shape of the current density profile also has an impact on the propagation of the waves and the resulting power deposition. In discharges where the current profile is dominated by LH current drive (LHCD), this dependence leads to the auto-regulation of the LHCD via the current density profile. The RT/FP technique reproduces at least qualitatively some of the experimental trends, though inconsistencies still remain. Perspectives for improving the relevance of the modelling are discussed.},

This observation is directly linked to the presence of radially highly elongated vortices ("streamers") which lead to very effective cross-field transport.

   abstract = {In the context of gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations of microturbulence in magnetized toroidal plasmas, different treatments of the magnetic equilibrium are examined. Considering the Cyclone DIII-D base case parameter set [Dimits , Phys. Plasmas 7, 969 (2000)], significant differences in the linear growth rates, the linear and nonlinear critical temperature gradients, and the nonlinear ion heat diffusivities are observed between results obtained using either an s-alpha or a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium. Similar disagreements have been reported previously [Redd , Phys. Plasmas 6, 1162 (1999)]. In this paper it is shown that these differences result primarily from the approximation made in the standard implementation of the s-alpha model, in which the straight field line angle is identified to the poloidal angle, leading to inconsistencies of order epsilon (epsilon=a/R is the inverse aspect ratio, a the minor radius and R the major radius). An equilibrium model with concentric, circular flux surfaces and a correct treatment of the straight field line angle gives results very close to those using a finite epsilon, low beta MHD equilibrium. Such detailed investigation of the equilibrium implementation is of particular interest when comparing flux tube and global codes. It is indeed shown here that previously reported agreements between local and global simulations in fact result from the order epsilon inconsistencies in the s-alpha model, coincidentally compensating finite rho(*) effects in the global calculations, where rho(*)=rho(s)/a with rho(s) the ion sound Larmor radius. True convergence between local and global simulations is finally obtained by correct treatment of the geometry in both cases, and considering the appropriate rho(*)-> 0 limit in the latter case.},

   abstract = {The paper compares the transport properties of a set of dimensionless identity experiments performed between JET and JT-60U in the advanced tokamak regime with internal transport barrier, ITB. These International Tokamak Physics Activity, ITPA, joint experiments were carried out with the same plasma shape, toroidal magnetic field ripple and dimensionless profiles as close as possible during the ITB triggering phase in terms of safety factor, normalized Larmor radius, normalized collision frequency, thermal beta, ratio of ion to electron temperatures. Similarities in the ITB triggering mechanisms and sustainment were observed when a good match was achieved of the most relevant normalized profiles except the toroidal Mach number. Similar thermal ion transport levels in the two devices have been measured in either monotonic or non-monotonic q-profiles. In contrast, differences between JET and JT-60U were observed on the electron thermal and particle confinement in reversed magnetic shear configurations. It was found that the larger shear reversal in the very centre (inside normalized radius of 0.2) of JT-60U plasmas allowed the sustainment of stronger electron density ITBs compared with JET. As a consequence of peaked density profile, the core bootstrap current density is more than five times higher in JT-60U compared with JET. Thanks to the bootstrap effect and the slightly broader neutral beam deposition, reversed magnetic shear configurations are self-sustained in JT-60U scenarios. Analyses of similarities and differences between the two devices address key questions on the validity of the usual assumptions made in ITER steady scenario modelling, e. g. a flat density profile in the core with thermal transport barrier? Such assumptions have consequences on the prediction of fusion performance, bootstrap current and on the sustainment of the scenario.},

   abstract = {The recent progress in the experimental characterization of pedestal and ELM dynamics as well as in the insight into pedestal width scaling is reviewed. Various width scaling experiments from many devices indicate that the pedestal width scales weakly with the normalized ion Larmor radius and with the square root of the pedestal poloidal beta. The ELM onset in type I ELMy H-modes is consistently understood as an MHD stability limit on the maximum achievable edge pressure gradient. These results provide a prediction for the pedestal height in ITER. Time resolved measurements of pedestal parameters during the ELM cycle from various machines present a consistent picture of the pedestal dynamics, providing strong tests for pedestal models. Despite growing efforts in pedestal transport modelling, there is no consensus to date on what transport mechanism may explain the residual electron heat transport in the pedestal. As far as particle transport is concerned, a strong particle pinch may offset strong particle diffusion in the edge pedestal. Recent experiments have expanded the operational domains of the grassy ELM and QH-mode regimes and are consistent with predictions of the peeling-ballooning model.},

   abstract = {Pedestal and core confinement of hybrid discharges in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and DIII-D are studied in dedicated power scan experiments. The H98(y, 2) confinement factor increases with total beta(N) in both tokamaks and it is higher in DIII-D with higher delta plasma shape at a given beta(N). The pedestal beta, beta(PED)(N), increases linearly with total beta in AUG hybrid discharges, while it is roughly constant with beta(N) at fixed shape in the DIII-D power scans. The confinement enhancement with power observed with respect to the IPB98(y, 2) scaling is due to an increase in pedestal confinement in AUG hybrid discharges and to an increase in core confinement in the DIII-D hybrid power scans. The increase in pedestal pressure with power in AUG hybrid discharges is primarily due to an increase in the width of the edge transport barrier at constant pressure gradient. In the DIII-D discharges the widths of the T(e) and n(e) pedestals, Delta(Te) and Delta(ne), are consistent with a Delta similar to beta(1/2)(pol,PED) scaling. In the AUG hybrid power scans a dependence of Delta(Te) on beta(pol,PED) cannot be excluded, while Delta(ne) shows no dependence on beta(pol,PED) In both machines Delta(Ti) increases with beta. The maximum pedestal pressure achieved in the experiment prior to the onset of type I ELMs is consistent with predictions from ideal MHD; however, a physics model explaining the increase in the pedestal width with beta is still missing. The increase in R/L(Ti) with beta in the core of DIII-D is consistent with predictions by linear gyrokinetic simulations. In the plasma core, E x B shearing rate stabilization of the ITG modes is significant in both machines as beta is increased. Inclusion of electromagnetic effects in the gyrokinetic calculations provides additional stabilization at beta(N) values achieved in the experiment. In AUG, proximity to the kinetic ballooning threshold and/or a stronger reduction in normalized ion heat flux with increasing input power are possible explanations for the constancy of R/L(Ti) at mid-radius as beta is increased.},

   journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
   volume = {49},
   number = {11},
   abstract = {The injected power required to induce a transition from L-mode to H-mode plasmas is found to depend strongly on the injected neutral beam torque and consequent plasma toroidal rotation. Edge turbulence and flows, measured near the outboard midplane of the plasma (0.85 < r/a < 1.0) on DIII-D with the high-sensitivity 2D beam emission spectroscopy (BES) system, likewise vary with rotation and suggest a causative connection. The L-H power threshold in plasmas with the ion del B drift directed away from the X-point decreases from 4-6 MW with co-current beam injection, to 2-3 MW near zero net injected torque and to <2 MW with counter-injection in the discharges examined. Plasmas with the ion del B drift directed towards the X-point exhibit a qualitatively similar though less pronounced power threshold dependence on rotation. 2D edge turbulence measurements with BES show an increasing poloidal flow shear as the L-H transition is approached in all conditions. As toroidal rotation is varied from co-current to balanced in L-mode plasmas, the edge turbulence changes from a uni-modal character to a bi-modal structure, with the appearance of a low-frequency (f = 10-50 kHz) mode propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction, similar to what is observed as the ion del B drift is directed towards the X-point in co-rotating plasmas. At low rotation, the poloidal turbulence flow near the edge reverses prior to the L-H transition, generating a significant poloidal flow shear that exceeds the measured turbulence decorrelation rate. This increased poloidal turbulence velocity shear appears to facilitate the L-H transition. No such reversal is observed in high rotation plasmas. The high-frequency poloidal turbulence velocity spectrum exhibits a transition from a geodesic acoustic mode zonal flow to a higher-power, lower frequency zero-mean-frequency zonal flow as rotation varies from co-current to balanced during a torque scan at constant injected neutral beam power, perhaps also facilitating the L-H transition. This reduced power threshold at lower toroidal rotation may benefit inherently low-rotation plasmas such as ITER.},

The pedestal degradation due to the Ne seeding is taken as input. The impact of Z(eff) and radiative loss on the heat transport are modeled with the quasi-linear 1D fluid code RITM. The input parameters are taken from a series of Ne seeded discharges conducted in JET. Discharges with D, D + Ne and Ne only fueling are qualitatively analyzed. The model recovers the experimentally observed fact that, while the confinement is degraded from the D to the D + Ne seeded plasma, it is improved from the D + Ne to the Ne only seeded plasma.},

The choice of a water bag representation allows an elegant link between kinetic and fluid descriptions of a plasma. The gyrowater bag model has been recently adapted to the context of strongly magnetized plasmas. We present its extension to the case of multi ion species magnetized plasmas: each ion species being modeled via a multiwater bag distribution function. The water bag modelization will be discussed in details, under the simplification of a cylindrical geometry that is convenient for linear plasma devices. As an illustration, results obtained in the linear framework for ion temperature gradient instabilities are presented, that are shown to agree qualitatively with older works.

In this context, we have studied the behaviour of four different impurity species in Tore Supra lower-hybrid heated, sawtooth-free plasmas. We observe a decrease in the central impurity confinement time iota(imp) with increasing Z in the range explored ( from 13 up to 32). This result is in contradiction to both neoclassical and turbulent theoretical predictions. An analysis with the 1D impurity transport code ITC shows the existence of a central zone with reduced diffusion and indication of an inward convection. These results are completed with theoretical simulations of neoclassical transport (NCLASS) and turbulent transport with the quasilinear gyrokinetic QuaLiKiz and nonlinear gyrofluid TRB models. These simulations do not provide an explanation of the confinement time dependence on the impurity charge. Transport outside r/a = 0.3 is well described by the nonlinear turbulent calculations but the central region is predicted to be below the turbulence threshold while the observed transport is one order of magnitude higher than neoclassical values. The gyrokinetic calculations evidence the dominant role of the curvature pinch in the total convective flux. This term is directed inwards and only weakly dependent on the impurity charge in the explored range of species.},

   volume = {17},

   abstract = {A new model is developed for transport driven by drift-resistive-inertial ballooning modes (DRIBMs) in axisymmetric tokamak plasmas. The model is derived using two-fluid reduced Braginskii equations in a generalized s-alpha geometry. The unified theory includes diamagnetic effects, parallel electron and ion dynamics, electron inertia, magnetic perturbations, transverse particle diffusion, gyroviscous stress terms, electron and ion equilibrium temperature gradients, and temperature perturbations. A mixing length approximation is used to compute electron and ion thermal transport as well as particle fluxes from eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linearized equations. The prediction for the saturation level is obtained by balancing the DRIBM growth rate against the nonlinear E X B convection. The parametric dependence of DRIBMs is investigated in systematic scans over density gradient, electron and ion temperature gradients, magnetic-q, collision frequency, magnetic shear, and Larmor radius. The DRIBM threshold is determined as a function of the collision frequency and the density and temperature gradients. The transition from DRIBM to the toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode is observed for small density gradients. For steep density gradients, the effect of ITG on DRIBM is found to be stabilizing. The transport seen in the DRIBM is of a scale that is consistent with the observed experimental anomalous transport, suggesting that the DRIBM mode could be the principle agent responsible for edge transport in Ohmic and L-mode discharges.

In accordance with the expectations, long distance (10 cm) power coupling has been obtained. Successive stationary states of the plasma current pro le have been controlled in real-time featuring (i) control of sawteeth with varying plasma parameters, (ii) obtaining and sustaining a 'hot core' plasma regime, (iii) recovery from a voluntarily triggered deleterious magnetohydrodynamic regime. The scrape-off layer (SOL) parameters and power deposition have been documented during L-mode ramp-up phase, a crucial point for ITER before the X-point formation. Disruption mitigation studies have been conducted with massive gas injection, evidencing the difference between He and Ar and the possible role of the q = 2 surface in limiting the gas penetration. ICRF assisted wall conditioning in the presence of magnetic eld has been investigated, culminating in the demonstration that this conditioning scheme allows one to recover normal operation after disruptions. The effect of the magnetic eld ripple on the intrinsic plasma rotation has been studied, showing the competition between turbulent transport processes and ripple toroidal friction. During dedicated dimensionless experiments, the effect of varying the collisionality on turbulence wavenumber spectra has been documented, giving new insight into the turbulence mechanism. Turbulence measurements have also allowed quantitatively comparing experimental results with predictions by 5D gyrokinetic codes: numerical results simultaneously match the magnitude of effective heat diffusivity, rms values of density uctuations and wavenumber spectra. A clear correlation between electron temperature gradient and impurity transport in the very core of the plasma has been observed, strongly suggesting the existence of a threshold above which transport is dominated by turbulent electron modes. Dynamics of edge turbulent uctuations has been studied by correlating data from fast imaging cameras and Langmuir probes, yielding a coherent picture of transport processes involved in the SOL.},

Recent results from DIII-D provide the first experimental evidence that, in addition, intermediate-scale turbulence (0.5 < k(theta)rho(s) <= 3) is reduced at the L- H transition. A 30-40% prompt reduction (r/a >= 0.7) has been found at the L- H transition in co-injected medium density plasmas, with a larger decrease (>= 75%) observed near the pedestal top. Experimental results and TGLF calculations indicate that intermediate/small scale turbulence persists in H- mode at a reduced amplitude (0.6 <= r/a <= 1) and may substantially contribute to the residual anomalous H- mode electron heat transport.},

The difference in physical character from more familiar MHD models is also addressed.

   abstract = {The competition between drift wave and interchange physics in general E-cross-B drift turbulence is studied with computations in three-dimensional tokamak flux tube geometry. For a given set of background scales, the parameter space can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave collisionality. At large enough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out into ideal ballooning modes and saturates only by depleting the free energy in the background pressure gradient. At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to resistive ballooning. At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave character, qualitatively identical to simple two-dimensional slab models. The underlying cause is the nonlinear vorticity advection through which the self-sustained drift wave turbulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering their structure apart before they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the dynamics. This vorticity advection catalyses the gradient drive, while saturation occurs solely through turbulent mixing of pressure disturbances. This situation persists in the whole of tokamak edge parameter space. Both simplified isothermal models and complete warm ion models are treated. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

The analysed database includes ohmic (OH) plasmas with various current ramp rates and plasma densities and the L-mode plasmas with the ion cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF) and neutral beam injection (NB!) heating performed at various ICRF resonance positions and NBI heating powers. The emphasis of this analysis is a data consistency test, which is particularly important here because some parameters, useful for the transport model validation, are not measured in OH and ICRF heated plasmas (e.g. ion temperature, effective charge). The sensitivity of the predictive accuracy of the transport models to the unmeasured data is estimated. It is found that the Bohm-gyroBohm model satisfactorily predicts the temperature evolution in discharges with central heating (the rms deviation between the simulated and measured temperature is within 15%), but underestimates the thermal electron transport in the OH and off-axis ICRF heated discharges. The Coppi-Tang model strongly underestimates the thermal transport in all discharges considered. A re-normalization of these empirical models for improving their predictive capability is proposed. The GLF23 model, strongly dependent on the ion temperature gradient and tested only for NBI heated discharges with measured ion temperatures, predicts accurately the temperature in the low power NBI heated discharge (rms < 10%) while the discrepancy with the data increases at high power. Based on the analysis of the JET discharges, the modelling of the current ramp-up phase for the H-mode ITER scenario is performed with particular emphasis on the sensitivity of the sawtooth-free duration of this phase to transport model.},

One set, called the pre-experiment simulations, was performed prior to the experiment in order to predict a change in alpha(neTe) given experimentally realizable increases in the electron temperature, T(e). In the experiment the cross-phase angle was measured at three radial locations (rho=0.55, 0.65, and 0.75) in both a "Base" case and a "High T(e)" case. The measured cross-phase angle is in good qualitative agreement with the pre-experiment simulations, which predicted that (n) over tilde (e) and (T) over tilde (e) would be out of phase. The pre-experiment simulations also predicted a decrease in cross-phase angle as T(e) is increased. Experimentally, this trend is observed at the inner two radial locations only. The second set of simulations, the postexperiment simulations, is carried out using local parameters taken from measured experimental profiles as input to GYRO. These postexperiment simulation results are in good quantitative agreement with the measured cross-phase angle, despite disagreements with transport fluxes.

   abstract = {The mechanisms of turbulent transport in the collisional tokamak edge plasma are investigated linearly and nonlinearly, focusing specifically on the transition from resistive modes to ion temperature gradient driven (eta(i)) modes. Linear eigenvalue calculations demonstrate that resistive ballooning and toroidal eta(i) modes can exist as separate roots with similar growth rates but with differing structure along the magnetic field. While the typical transverse scale length of the resistive modes depends strongly on collisionality, the transverse scales of the eta(i) mode are essentially independent of the collisionality, even in the absence of any assumption on the adiabaticity of the electrons. Three-dimensional nonlinear simulations quantitatively describe the transition between the resistivity dominated outermost edge and regions with moderately higher temperature where resistive modes are stabilized and the collisionless eta(i) mode dominates. A significant result is that the eta(i) modes continue to drive significant particle transport even in regimes where the linear stability analysis indicates the electrons are dominantly adiabatic. The particle transport is driven by the nonadiabatic, long-parallel-wavelength component of the wave spectrum. As in earlier calculations of eta(i) turbulence, the self-generated poloidal flows are relatively strong, much stronger than in cold ion simulations, and strongly influence the saturation levels and associated transport rates. The implications of the results for understanding edge transport and density and temperature profiles are discussed. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics. [S1070-664X(98)03007-9].},

The H-mode power threshold, P TH , was evaluated for different operational configurations and auxiliary heating methods for the different main ion species. Helium plasmas have significantly higher P TH than deuterium plasmas at low densities for all heating schemes, but similar P TH as deuterium plasmas at high densities except for H-neutral beam injection-heated discharges, which are still higher. Changes in P TH are observed when helium concentration levels in deuterium plasmas exceed 40%. There is a strong dependence of P TH on the magnetic geometry in the vicinity of the divertor. The trend of decreasing P TH with decreasing X-point height is observed for all of the main ion species irrespective of the heating method, which appears to indicate that there is a common physics process behind this effect for all of the ion species. Helium and deuterium plasmas exhibit a significant increase in P TH for strong resonant magnetic perturbations. The application of a local magnetic ripple of 3% from test blanket module mock-up coils did not change P TH in deuterium plasmas.}

Equivalent septum configurations run with the new septum replacement plate (SRP) in the MkII Gas Box divertor have shown that the presence of the septum lowers the L–H transition power threshold, P th , by 20%. For X-point to virtual septum top distances of less than 6 cm, the SRP plasmas also demonstrate a significant decrease of the L–H P th and pedestal electron temperature, T e with reduced X-point height. Although, the SRP plasma's P th remains above that with the septum, there is no difference in the pedestal T e at the L–H transition. The influence of plasma shaping on the L–H transition has also been investigated for the first time on JET in a series of density scans at I p / B t of 2.5 MA/2.7 T. While keeping the lower triangularity, δ lower , and divertor geometry constant, the upper triangularity, δ upper , has been increased from 0.23 to 0.34 with no effect on P th or the pedestal T e or T i . In a separate edge n e scan, two configurations with different δ upper /δ lower values of 0.23/0.23 and 0.43/0.33 have been compared. A large difference in the transition threshold is observed at values of edge n e above 1.8 × 10 19  m −3 , with the higher δ plasmas characterized by P th of up to 25% lower at the highest densities scanned. This is thought to be the result of lowered X-point and outer strike point heights with increased δ.}

  abstract={A new model of the L–H transition in tokamaks is proposed, based on the criterion that the transition occurs when plasma turbulence and shear Alfvén waves compete in the vicinity of the last-closed flux surface. The model is used to predict the scaling of the H-mode access power, P L–H , with magnetic and plasma variables. The predictions are in good agreement with the experimental scaling of P L–H with plasma size, density, magnetic field and edge safety factor (plasma current). They are also qualitatively consistent with the dependence of P L–H on ion mass and charge, limiter versus divertor plasmas, single versus double null configurations, the divertor leg length and H–L versus L–H hysteresis. Most notably, the model explains the appearance of the minimum in P L–H with plasma density (in terms of the transition between sheath limited and conduction limited scrape-off layer (SOL) transport) and correctly predicts the scaling of the density minimum with magnetic field and Greenwald number. Finally, the effect of toroidal field reversal is included by making the normalized correlation length of the eddy and maximum safety factor in the edge-SOL layer functions of B × ∇ B direction.}

Steady I-mode plasmas have been produced over a wide range of plasma field (3–6 T), current (0.8–1.35 MA), density and shaping in the unfavourable ion B × ∇ B configuration. The power threshold for the L–I transition is higher than scalings for the L–H transition with favourable drift, and increases with plasma current as well as density. Threshold conditions for the I–H transition are more variable. In some conditions I-mode is maintained up to the maximum available ICRF power of 5 MW, nearly a factor of two above the L–I threshold, giving a robust operating window. Edge T e at the L–I transition is in the range 250–450 eV, over a range of current and density, about a factor of two higher than with favourable drift, while at the I–H transition it can be much higher (up to 1.1 keV) but is again widely variable.

  abstract={On DIII-D, the H-mode power threshold has been determined for hydrogen, deuterium and helium plasmas heated by neutral beam injection and/or by electron cyclotron heating and as a function of the applied torque plasmas for plasma configurations in the favourable ion grad- B drift direction. The H-mode threshold power has been determined to increase with input torque for all the main ion species (hydrogen, deuterium and helium). The H-mode threshold power for similar plasma parameters and configurations is the least for deuterium, followed by helium and hydrogen in that order. The plasma geometry also affects the power threshold, which is dependent on the X-point height.}

  abstract={One of the critical issues for ITER is access to an H-mode regime with good confinement, H 98 = 1. The most basic scaling laws for power threshold for the L–H transition, P th , take the variation with plasma density, magnetic field and plasma size into account. However, the large variations in the P th data from the values estimated with such simple scaling laws indicate other underlying dependencies. Another important consideration for ITER is that H-modes with higher values of energy confinement factors are often obtained with input power values much greater than P th . This paper presents results from recent studies on JET to assess possible hidden variables for H-mode access over a wide range of plasma conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that sensitivity to the magnetic shaping and divertor geometry could account for some of the scatter in the international power threshold database. Hysteresis in the L–H transition P th has been studied in detail for the first time on JET by comparing values of P th at the forward and back H-mode transitions over a range of densities. The impact of the edge plasma rotation on H-mode access has also been considered on JET with a toroidal field ripple scan across the L–H and H–L transitions. Finally, the total input power required relative to the measured value of P th for access to a steady-state H-mode with H 98 = 1 has been examined for a highly shaped magnetic configuration. The implications of these results for the attainment of H-mode with good confinement on ITER are discussed.}

  abstract={An important contribution to the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium at the tokamak edge comes from the Pfirsch–Schlüter current. The parallel electric field that can be associated with these currents is necessarily poloidally asymmetric and makes a similarly nonuniform contribution to the radial electric field on a flux surface. Here the role of the poloidal variation of this radial electric field in the L–H transition power threshold is investigated. Dependence of the resulting electric fields on magnetic topology, geometric factors such as the upper/lower triangularity and elongation, and the relative position of the X-point(s) in the poloidal plane are examined in detail. Starting with the assumption that an initially more negative radial electric field at the edge helps lower the transition power threshold, we find that our results are in agreement with a variety of experimental observations. In particular, for a ‘normal’ configuration of the plasma current and toroidal field we show the following. (i) The net radial electric field contribution by the Pfirsch–Schlüter currents at the plasma edge is negative for a lower single null and positive for a corresponding upper single null geometry. (ii) It becomes more negative as the X-point height is reduced. (iii) It also becomes more negative as the X-point radius is increased. These observations are consistent with the observed changes in the L–H transition power threshold P LH under similar changes in the experimental conditions. In addition we find that (iv) in USN with an unfavourable ion ∇ B drift direction, the net radial electric field contribution is positive but decreases as the X-point radius decreases. This is consistent with the C-Mod observation that an L–I mode transition can be triggered by increasing the upper triangularity in this configuration. (v) Locally the radial electric field is positive above the outer mid-plane and reverses sign with reversal of the toroidal field, consistent with DIII-D observations in low-power L-mode discharges. Thus, taken as a whole, the Pfirsch–Schlüter current-driven fields can explain a number of observations on the L–H or L–I transition and the required power threshold P LH levels not captured by simple scaling laws. They may indeed be an important ‘hidden variable’.}

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the dynamics of the low(L)! high(H) transition using a
   time-dependent, one dimensional (in radius) model which
   self-consistently describes the time evolution of zonal flows (ZFs),
   mean flows (MFs), poloidal spin-up, and density and pressure profiles.
   The model represents the physics of ZF and MF competition, turbulence
   suppression via E x B shearing, and poloidal flows driven by turbulence.
   Numerical solutions of this model show that the L -> H transition can
   occur via an intermediate phase (I-phase) which involves oscillations of
   profiles due to ZF and MF competition. The I-phase appears as a
   nonlinear transition wave originating at the edge boundary and
   propagates inward. Locally, I-phase exhibits the characteristics of a
   limit-cycle oscillation. All these observations are consistent with
   recent experimental results. We examine the trigger of the L -> H
   transition, by defining a ratio of the rate of energy transfer from the
   turbulence to the zonal flow to the rate of energy input into the
   turbulence. When the ratio exceeds order unity, ZF shear gains energy,
   and a net decay of the turbulence is possible, thus triggering the L ->
   H transition. Numerical calculations indicate that the L -> H transition
   is triggered by this peak of the normalized ZF shearing. Zonal flows act
   as ``reservoir,{''} in which to store increasing fluctuation energy
   without increasing transport, thus allowing the mean flow shear to
   increase and lock in the transition. A counterpart of the L -> I -> H
   transition, i.e., an L -> H transition without I-phase, is obtained in a
   fast power ramp, for which I-phase is compressed into a single burst of
   ZF, which triggers the transition. Effects of neutral charge exchange on
   the L -> H transition are studied by varying ZF damping and neoclassical
   viscosity. Results show that the predicted L -> H transition power
   increases when either ZF damping or viscosity increase, suggesting a
   link between recycling, ZF damping, and the L -> H threshold. Studies of
   fueling effects on the transition and pedestal structure with an
   emphasis on the particle pinch are reported. (C) 2012 American Institute

  abstract={To understand the L–H transition, one has to identify the modes to be stabilized at the edge of L-mode plasmas, roughly from ρ = 0.7 to the last closed flux surface. To address this issue, realistic edge tokamak parameters inspired by three different L-modes from DIII-D and Tore Supra have been investigated with a gyrokinetic code GENE (Jenko et al 2000 Phys. Plasmas 7 1904). Former fluid theories for such parameters predict resistive ballooning modes (RBMs) to be unstable (Rogers et al 1998 Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 4396). In this paper, linear gyrokinetic simulations demonstrate that, under realistic L-mode conditions, RBMs are linearly unstable at every edge, i.e. ρ ⩾ 0.93. These modes predominantly drift in the electron diamagnetic direction at low wave numbers and are destabilized by higher collisionality. They are further destabilized by higher normalized temperature gradient and higher q . The magnetic shear and the density gradient length have a weaker impact.}

  abstract={The input power requirements for accessing H-mode at low density and maintaining it during the density ramp in ITER is addressed by statistical means applied to the international H-mode threshold power database. Following the recent addition of new data, the improvement of existing data and the improvement of selection criteria, a revised scaling law that describes the threshold power required to obtain an L-mode to H-mode transition is presented. Predictions for ITER give a threshold power of ~52MW in a deuterium plasma at a line average density, n e = 0.5×10 20 m -3 . At the nominal ITER H-mode density, n e = 1.0×10 20 m -3 , the threshold power required is ~86MW. Detailed analysis of data from individual devices suggests that the density dependence of the threshold power might increase with the plasma size and the magnetic field. On the other hand, the density at which the threshold power is minimal is found to decrease with the plasma size and increase with magnetic field. The influence of these effects on the accessibility of the H-mode regime in ITER plasmas is discussed. Analyses of the confinement database show that, in present day devices, H-modes are generally maintained with powers exceeding the threshold power by a factor larger than 1.5, and that, on the other hand, good confinement can be obtained close to the threshold power although rarely demonstrated.}

  abstract={The power threshold ( P Thresh ) to access the H-mode in tokamaks remains a subject of active research, because up to now no theoretical relation has proved to be general enough to reliably interpret the L–H transition. Over the last few decades, much effort has therefore been devoted to deriving empirical scalings, assuming ‘ a priori ’ a power-law model structure. In this paper, an empirical scaling of P Thresh without any a priori assumption about the model structure, i.e. about the functional form, is derived. Symbolic regression via genetic programming is applied to the latest version multi-machine International Tokamak Physics Activity International Global Power Threshold Data Base of validated ITER-like discharges. The derived model structure of the scaling for the global database is not in a power law form and includes a term that indicates saturation of P Thresh with the strength of the toroidal field, plasma density and elongation. Furthermore, the single machine analysis of the database for the most representative machines of the international fusion scientific program demonstrates that the model structures are similar but the model parameters are different. The better extrapolation capability of the identified model structures with the proposed methodology is verified with a specific analysis of JET data at two different current regimes. The P Thresh values extrapolated to ITER using the derived empirical model structures are a factor of two lower than those of traditional scaling laws and are predicted with a significantly better confidence.}

  abstract={Kinetic edge profiles are measured with high spatial and temporal resolution and their behaviour before and after the time of the L–H transition is analysed. It is shown that at low densities electron and ion channels are strongly decoupled and that the ion kinetic profiles determine the transition to H-mode. At medium densities, where electrons and ions are coupled, the H–L back-transition occurs at the same pressure gradients as the L–H transition. The threshold power for the H–L back-transition exhibits the same increase at low densities as the L–H transition. After the L–H transition the density development depends on the available neutral gas reservoir. Modelling of particle transport indicates that the temporal development of th/e density profiles can be reproduced assuming only a reduction in the edge diffusion coefficient. The influence of magnetic perturbation coils on the L–H transition power threshold strongly increases with density above a Greenwald factor of about 0.6.}

  abstract={This paper presents the results from a systematic study of low-to-high confinement transition (L–H transition) in Alcator C-Mod lower single null plasmas, with ion ∇ B drift in the favourable direction for H-mode access. The study is performed over a broad range of plasma density ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in001.gif] {(0.6\times 10^{20}\,{\rm m}^{-3}<\bar {n}_{\rm e} <2.5\times 10^{20}\,{\rm m}^{-3})} , toroidal magnetic field (3.5 T < B T < 5.4 T) and plasma current (0.6 MA < I p < 1.4 MA). In particular, data at low plasma density of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in002.gif] {\bar {n}_{\rm e} <1.0\times 10^{20}\,{\rm m}^{-3}} , which were not included or carefully examined by earlier C-Mod studies, are highlighted in our analysis. With the large set of data, the scaling of H-mode threshold power ( P th ) and local plasma edge conditions with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in003.gif] {\bar {n}_{\rm e}} , B T and I p are obtained. We found the P th dependence on ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in003.gif] {\bar {n}_{\rm e}} is nonlinear and exhibits a 'U-shape', which is not sensitive to I p variation, and affected by B T mainly at low density. The characterized L–H local edge conditions include the amplitude and gradient scale length of T e , n e profiles. In all, the scaling of L–H P th and edge conditions are complex, neither of which can be simply represented by a relation of the type ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in004.gif] {\bar {n}_{\rm e}^x B_{\rm T}^y I_{\rm p}^z} . Local edge conditions are also evaluated in low-power L-mode and compared with the L–H companion. Noticeable differences between L-mode and L–H are mainly observed in T e at ψ = 0.95, and L n , L T near separatrix, while other parameters are found to be not significantly changed. Comparison with resistive-ballooning mode theory yields reasonable good agreement, such that the experimental data at ψ = 0.95 fit into the corresponding L-mode and H-mode domains, as well as L–H boundary predicted by theory. Finally, we see an edge T e pedestal emerging in a low density ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/2/023010/nf403431in005.gif] {(\bar {n}_{\rm e} \sim 0.6\times 10^{20}\,{\rm m}^{-3})} 5.4 T discharge prior to L–H transition.}

  abstract={The development of the electron density profile and its dependences after the L–H transition have been investigated. Only electron cyclotron resonance heated H-modes have been analysed to exclude core particle fuelling. While the density gradient in the edge transport barrier increases significantly after the L–H transition, the pedestal top temperature rises continuously with the applied heating power and shows no pronounced change at the transition. The H-mode density saturates at a level which correlates with the neutral gas density in the divertor prior to the L–H transition. Although the density build-up varies with the available deuterium inventory, the initial increase in the edge density gradient is similar. This has been observed independent of the L-mode plasma collisionality ( ν * ≈ 2.8–5.5). The analysis of electron density and temperature profiles reveals that L–H and H–L transitions occur at similar pedestal top pressures, but the pedestal top densities are always higher at the time of the H–L back transition.}

The zonal flow/field excitation mechanism in the electromagnetic regime can provide a possible explanation for the observed correlation between transport barrier formation and low shear rational surfaces in the plasma.}

  abstract={The installation of a new poloidal charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic at ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) has enabled the determination of the radial electric field, E r , using the radial force balance of impurity ions. E r has been derived from charge exchange (CX) spectra measured on different impurity species, such as He 2+ , B 5+ , C 6+ and Ne 10+ . The resulting E r profiles are found to be identical within the uncertainties regardless of the impurity species used, thus, demonstrating the validity of the diagnostic technique. The E r profile has been compared to the main ion pressure gradient term, which is found to be the dominant contribution at the plasma edge, thus, supporting that the E r well is created by the main ion species. The E r profile has been measured in different confinement regimes including L-, I- and H-mode. The depth of the E r well and the magnitude of the E r shear are correlated with the ion pressure at the pedestal top. The temporal evolution of the measured CX profiles and the resulting E r have been studied during an edge-localized mode (ELM) cycle. At the ELM crash, the E r minimum is less deep resulting in a reduction of the E × B shear. Within 2 ms after the ELM crash, the edge kinetic profiles have nearly recovered and the E r well is observed to recover simultaneously. In high density type-I ELM mitigated H-mode plasmas, obtained via externally applied magnetic perturbations (MPs) with toroidal mode number n = 2, no clear effect on E r due to the MPs has been observed.}

  abstract={Results of stability analysis are presented for two types of plasma with good confinement: internal transport barriers (ITBs) on Tore Supra and the radiative improved (RI) mode on TEXTOR. The stability analysis has been performed with an electrostatic linear gyrokinetic code, evaluating the growth rates of microinstabilities. The code developed, KINEZERO, is aimed at systematic microstability analysis. Therefore the trade-off between having perfect quantitative agreement and minimizing computation time is made in favour of the latter. In the plasmas analysed, it is found that the onset of the confinement improvement involves a trigger. For the ITB discharges, negative magnetic shear is involved, whereas for the RI discharges, the triggering role is played by the increase of the impurity concentration. Once the improved confinement is triggered, the simultaneous increases of temperature and density gradients imply an increase in both the growth rate and the rotation shearing rate. The rotation shear is found to be high enough to maintain an improved confinement through the stabilization of the large scale modes.}

Essential for accurate momentum flux predictions, the parallel asymmetrization of the eigenfunctions is successfully recovered by an analytical fluid model. This is tested against self-consistent gyrokinetic calculations and allows for a correct prediction of the E × B shear impact on the saturated potential amplitude by means of a mixing length rule. Hence, the effect of the E × B shear is recovered on all the transport channels including the induced residual stress. Including these additions, QuaLiKiz remains ∼10 000 faster than non-linear gyrokinetic codes allowing for comparisons with experiments without resorting to high performance computing. The example is given of momentum pinch calculations in NBI modulation experiments (Tala et al 2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.075001] 075001 ) for which the inward convection of the momentum is correctly predicted.}

  abstract={A formalism is presented which is suitable for the analysis of a collisionless plasma sheet confined by a static magnetic field in the presence of a small-amplitude alternating electromagnetic field. Each particle is described by angular and action variables which allow the calculation of the stationary state of the plasma in the presence of the alternating field by a variational method. A dispersion relation for the actual eigenmodes of the plasma is also derived. This formalism is used to study a stabilizing effect of the alternating field which takes place when the field has a standing-wave structure along the direction of the confinement. This effect is connected with the mean particl e velocities which are induced along the direction of the diamagnetic current. It is shown that th e drift modes and the interchange modes in the plasma may be stabilized, when discarding the parametric amplification effects and the non-linear Landau effects, if the values assumed by these mean velocities are spread over an interval of the order of the diamagnetic velocity.}

  abstract={Experiments on HL-2A, DIII-D and EAST show that turbulence just inside the last closed flux surface acts to reinforce existing sheared E × B flows in this region. This flow drive gets stronger as heating power is increased in L-mode, and leads to the development of a strong oscillating shear flow which can transition into the H-mode regime when the rate of energy transfer from the turbulence to the shear flow exceeds a threshold. These effects become compressed in time during an L–H transition, but the key role of turbulent flow drive during the transition is still observed. The results compare favourably with a reduced predator–prey type model.}

Abstract = {{Shear flow stabilization of edge turbulence in tokamaks has been the
   accepted paradigm for the improvement in confinement observed in high
   (H) confinement mode plasmas. Results on the generation of zonal flow
   and fields in finite beta plasmas are presented. This theory yields a
   criterion for bifurcation from low to high (L-H) confinement mode,
   proportional to T-e/rootL(n), where T-e is the electron temperature and
   L-n is the density scale-length at the steepest part of the density
   gradient. When this parameter exceeds a critical value (mostly
   determined by the strength of the toroidal magnetic field), the
   transition occurs. The predicted threshold based on this parameter shows
   good agreement with edge measurements on discharges undergoing L-H
   transitions in DIII-D {[}J. L. Luxon, R. Anderson, F. Batty , in
   Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled
   Fusion Research, 1986 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna,
   1987), Vol. I, p. 159]. The observed differences in the transitions with
   the reversal of the toroidal magnetic field are reconciled in terms of
   this critical parameter due to the differences in the density gradient
   scale-lengths in the edge. The theory also provides a possible
   explanation for lowered threshold power, pellet injection H modes in
   DIII-D, thereby providing a unified picture of the varied observations
   on the L-H transition. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.}},

  abstract={In this paper, the nature of the primary instability present in the pedestal forming region prior to the transition into H mode is analysed using a gyrokinetic code on JET-ILW profiles. The linear analysis shows that the primary instability is of resistive nature, and can therefore be stabilized by increased temperature, hence power. The unstable modes are identified as being resistive ballooning modes. Their growth rates decrease for temperatures increasing towards the experimentally measured temperature at the L–H transition. The growth rates are larger for lower effective charge Z eff . This dependence is shown to be in qualitative agreement with recent and past experimental observations of reduced Z eff associated with lower L–H power thresholds.}

  abstract={A comparison of the L–H power threshold ( P thr ) in JET with all carbon, JET-C, and beryllium/tungsten wall (the ITER-like choice), JET-ILW, has been carried out in experiments with slow input power ramps and matched plasma shapes, divertor configuration and I P / B T pairs. The low density dependence of the L–H power threshold, namely an increase below a minimum density n e,min , which was first observed in JET with the MkII-GB divertor and C wall and subsequently not observed with the current MkII-HD geometry, is observed again with JET-ILW. At plasma densities above n e,min , P thr is reduced by ∼30%, and by ∼40% when the radiation from the bulk plasma is subtracted ( P sep ), with JET-ILW compared to JET-C. At the L–H transition the electron temperature at the edge, where the pedestal later develops, is also lower with JET-ILW, for a given edge density. With JET-ILW the minimum density is found to increase roughly linearly with magnetic field, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/54/2/023007/nf484102ieqn001.gif] {$n_{{\rm e},{\rm min}} \sim B_{{\rm T}}^{4/5}$} , while the power threshold at the minimum density scales as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/54/2/023007/nf484102ieqn002.gif] {$P_{{\rm sep},\min} \sim B_{{\rm T}}^{5/2}$} . The H-mode power threshold in JET-ILW is found to be sensitive both to variations in main plasma shape ( P sep decreases with increasing lower triangularity and increases with upper triangularity) and in divertor configuration. When the data are recast in terms of P sep and Z eff or subdivertor neutral pressure a linear correlation is found, pointing to a possible role of Z eff and/or subdivertor neutral pressure in the L–H transition physics. Depending on the chosen divertor configuration, P thr can be up to a factor of two lower than the ITPA scaling law for densities above n e,min . A shallow edge radial electric field well is observed at the L–H transition. The edge impurity ion poloidal velocity remains low, close to its L-mode values, ⩽5 km s −1 ± 2–3 km s −1 , at the L–H transition and throughout the H-mode phase, with no measureable increase within the experimental uncertainties. The edge toroidal rotation profile does not contribute to the depth of the negative E r well and thus may not be correlated with the formation of the edge transport barrier in JET.}

   L-H transition physics mechanism through the main ion pressure gradient
   which is itself the main contribution to the radial electric field and
   the induced flow shearing at the edge. The electron channel does not
   play any role. The 3D magnetic field perturbations used to mitigate the
   edge-localized modes are found to also influence the L-H transition and
   to increase the power threshold. This effect is caused by a flattening
   of the edge pressure gradient in the presence of the 3D fields such that
   the L-H transitions with and without perturbations occur at the same
   value of the radial electric field well, but at different heating
   powers.}},

The density range was extended to 0.6 n GWL ( = I p /π a 2 ), where a stronger than linear density dependence was found. A reduction of the radiation power and edge temperature as well as a nonlinear increase in edge density were also observed. The poloidal distribution of the neutral particle density was first examined in this work, and it was found that compression of neutral particles near the X-point or loss of homogeneity on a flux surface produced by the modification of the divertor geometry may be an influential determinant of the L-H threshold power.}

   tokamak edge plasmas}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A new model is developed for transport driven by
   drift-resistive-inertial ballooning modes (DRIBMs) in axisymmetric
   tokamak plasmas. The model is derived using two-fluid reduced Braginskii
   equations in a generalized s-alpha geometry. The unified theory includes
   diamagnetic effects, parallel electron and ion dynamics, electron
   inertia, magnetic perturbations, transverse particle diffusion,
   gyroviscous stress terms, electron and ion equilibrium temperature
   gradients, and temperature perturbations. A mixing length approximation
   is used to compute electron and ion thermal transport as well as
   particle fluxes from eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linearized
   equations. The prediction for the saturation level is obtained by
   balancing the DRIBM growth rate against the nonlinear E X B convection.
   The parametric dependence of DRIBMs is investigated in systematic scans
   over density gradient, electron and ion temperature gradients,
   magnetic-q, collision frequency, magnetic shear, and Larmor radius. The
   DRIBM threshold is determined as a function of the collision frequency
   and the density and temperature gradients. The transition from DRIBM to
   the toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode is observed for small
   density gradients. For steep density gradients, the effect of ITG on
   DRIBM is found to be stabilizing. The transport seen in the DRIBM is of
   a scale that is consistent with the observed experimental anomalous
   transport, suggesting that the DRIBM mode could be the principle agent
   responsible for edge transport in Ohmic and L-mode discharges. (C) 2010

  abstract={Theory of ion temperature gradient (ITG) and trapped electron modes (TEMs) is applied to the study of particle transport in experimental conditions with central electron heating. It is shown that in the unstable domain of TEMs, the electron thermodiffusive flux is directed outwards. By means of such a flux, a mechanism is identified likely to account for density flattening with central electron heating. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental observations in ASDEX Upgrade. A parameter domain (including L- and H-mode plasmas) is identified, in which flattening with central electron heating is observed in the experiments. In general, this domain turns out to be the same domain in which the dominant plasma instability is a TEM. On the contrary, the dominant instability is an ITG in plasmas whose density profile is not affected significantly by central electron heating. The flattening predicted by quasi-linear theory for low density L-mode plasmas is too small compared to the experimental observations. At very high density, even when the dominant instability is an ITG, electron heating can provide density flattening, via the coupling with the ion heat channel. In these conditions the anomalous diffusivity increases in response to the increased ion heat flux, while the large collisionality makes the anomalous pinch small and the Ware pinch important.}

It runs now with two sources in parallel: a fast swept source and a frequency synthesizer to measure during the same shot the density profile and density fluctuations. The accuracy of the density profile from reflectometry reduces uncertainties on fluctuation profile measurement. This double operating mode also offers two ways to probe MHD modes and the micro-turbulence.}

  development of new methods, reflectometry has become a common
  diagnostic on plasma fusion devices. This paper presents some results
  obtained with reflectometry on transport, turbulence and
  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). The emphasis is put on some new results
  from Tore-Supra. Combining the density profile and fluctuation
  measurement, it was shown on Tore-Supra that the particle pinch inside
  the q = 1 surface is close to the neoclassical value in ohmic plasma,
  while the observed small diffusion is in agreement with a very low
  level of density fluctuations inside the q = 1 surface. In b scaling
  experiments, no change in the fluctuation levels was found on
  Tore-Supra, in agreement with the observation of weak confinement
  degradation with increasing b. Zonal flows have been detected by
  Doppler reflectometry in ASDEX-U and with correlation reflectometry in
  T-10. On Tore-Supra, a fast decrease in the density fluctuation level
  at high poloidal wavenumbers was measured with Doppler reflectometry,
  suggesting a minor role of electron temperature gradient driven
  modes. Various forms of Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes (toroidal Alfv\'{e}n
  eigenmodes, Alfv\'{e}n cascades and possibly beta Alfv\'{e}n
  eigenmodes) have been detected with reflectometry in TFTR, JET and
  Tore-Supra. The density fluctuations induced by the mode were found to
  be higher on the high-field side.}

abstract={If the equations that describe the observed anomalous
transport in magnetic confinement systems are
invariant under a scale transformation then any
confinement time calculated from them must exhibit
the same invariance, no matter how intractable the
calculation. This principle places constraints on
the form of the confinement time scaling which are
characteristic of the plasma model represented by
the equations. These constraints reduce the number
of parameters which have to be investigated
empirically and can serve to indicate which plasma
models could describe the observed losses. By
extending this argument to specific models of
turbulent transport in which the magnetic
configuration and the physical mechanism for
transport are identified, one can closely define the
form of local transport coefficients-in certain
cases completely determining them. The paper
provides a review of these ideas, shows how they
provide a theoretical framework for discussing
existing empirical confinement scalings and
illustrates their use in classifying and determining
the form of local transport coefficients. }

Experiments in FTU allow the extension of similar studies carried out on other tokamaks to plasmas with higher density and higher magnetic field. Magnetic shear and electron temperature gradients are found to drive opposite turbulent particle flows in the gradient region (0.3 $<$ r/a [?] 0.5), while inward thermo-diffusion alone is found in the plasma core (r/a [?] 0.3). Density profiles at midradius appear to be controlled by a convective term proportional to the density and independent of the gradient of temperature and magnetic shear. A linear increase in density peaking versus effective collisionality is found, differing from the scaling observed in other FTU plasma regimes.}

  profiles in stationary conditions show that the density peaking factor
  ne0/ne in JET H modes increases from near 1.2 at high
  collisionality to around 1.5 as the plasma collisionality decreases
  towards the values expected for ITER. This result confirms an earlier
  observation on AUG. The density peaking behaviour of L modes is
  remarkably different from that of H modes, scaling with overall plasma
  shear as (ne0/[?]ne[?] [?] 1.5li), independently of
  collisionality. H-mode density profiles show no shear dependence,
  except at the lowest collisionalities. No evidence for LTe, LTi, r* or
  b dependences has been obtained. Carbon impurity density profiles from
  charge exchange spectroscopy are always less peaked than electron
  density profiles and usually flat in H modes. The peaking of the
  electron density profiles, together with the flatness of the impurity
  density profiles, are favourable for fusion performance if they can be
  extrapolated to ignited conditions.}

The European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) has been a study of conceptual designs of five commercial fusion power plants and the main emphasis was on system integration. It focused on five power plant models which are illustrative of a wider spectrum of possibilities. They are all based on the tokamak concept and they have approximately the same net electrical power output, 1500 MWe. These span a range from relatively near-term, based on limited technology and plasma physics extrapolations, to an advanced conception.The PPCS allows one to clarify the concept of DEMO, the device that will bridge the gap between ITER and the first-of-a-kind fusion power plant. An assessment of the PPCS models with limited extrapolations highlighted a number of issues that must be addressed to establish the DEMO physics and technological basis.}

  abstract={A review of the application of dimensionless parameter
scaling techniques to magnetic fusion experiments is presented. Because
the methods of this type of analysis are not generally known, a detailed
discussion of the basis for these techniques is given, including
examples. The primary applications and successes of these methods in
magnetic fusion research are in the area of transport of energy and
particles across surfaces of constant magnetic flux. The experimental
justification for the use of these techniques to describe transport is
given, and the applications are reviewed. The two key applications of
these techniques, the identification of the underlying physical
mechanisms that cause transport and the projection of the transport in
future devices from present-day experiments, are extensively
discussed. Comparison of the results of dimensionless parameter scaling
experiments with the regression analysis of multi-machine databases
points to limitations in the databases and the analysis of them as the
source of the discrepancies. These discrepancies have significant
implications for the design optimization of tokamaks, which are
discussed here. Finally, the application of dimensionless parameter
scaling techniques to plasma stability, to the boundary region between
closed and open field lines and to divertor operation in the open field
line region are reviewed and discussed.}  }

  abstract={Anomalous transport in tokamaks is generally attributed to turbulent fluctuations. Since a large variety of modes are potentially unstable, a wide range of short-scale fluctuations should be measured, with wavenumbers from kri [?] 0.1 to kri [?] 1. In the Tore Supra tokamak, a light scattering experiment has made possible fluctuation measurements in the medium- and high-k domains where a transition in the k-spectrum is observed: the fluctuation level decreases much faster than usual observations, typically with a power law S(k) [?] k[?]6. A scan of the ion Larmor radius shows that the transition wavenumber scales with ri around kri [?] 1.5. This transition indicates that a characteristic length scale should be involved to describe the fluctuation nonlinear dynamics in this range. The resulting very low level of fluctuations at high-k does not support a strong effect of turbulence driven by the electron temperature gradient. For this gyroradius scan, the characteristics of turbulence also exhibit a good matching with predictions from gyro-Bohm scaling: the typical scale length of turbulence scales with the ion Larmor radius, the typical timescales with a/cs; the turbulence level also scales with ri, according to the mixing length rule.}

                  k_\perp=-2\vec k_i , where k $_{ i }$ is the beam
                  wave-number at the reflection layer. On the Doppler
                  reflectometry system installed on Tore Supra, both
                  the scattering wave-number k $_{\&perp;}$ and the
                  scattering localization ( r / a ) can be changed
                  during the shot owing to the steppable probing
                  frequency and the motorized antenna. Operating in O
                  mode, the spatial and wave-number ranges depend
                  essentially on density profile, typically probing
                  0.5 $<$ r / a $<$ 0.95 and 2 $<$ k $<$
                  15\&thinsp;cm$^{\&minus;1}$. Wave number spectra are
                  similar to those obtained with conventional
                  scattering systems. The perpendicular fluctuation
                  velocity in the laboratory frame is obtained from
                  the Doppler shift of the frequency spectrum
                  \&Delta;\&omega; = k $_{\&perp;}$ v $_{\&perp;}$. It
                  is dominated by the plasma E $_{ r }$ $\times$ B
                  velocity. In the core, the latter is mainly due to
                  the projection of the toroidal velocity, as this is
                  shown by comparison with measurements by charge
                  exchange recombination spectroscopy. In the set of
                  analysed Tore Supra ohmic and ICRH plasmas, the
                  observed rotation is consistent with a poloidal
                  velocity in the electron diamagnetic direction
                  and/or a toroidal velocity in the counter current
                  direction. The detailed structure of the velocity
                  profile, at the edge and in different plasma
                  regimes, allows us then to get information on the
                  radial electric field distribution. The dynamics of
                  the fluctuation velocity can be studied from the
                  time frequency analysis of the signal, for
                  investigating intermittent behaviour and transient
                  regimes. }

  abstract={A broadband reflectometer operating in the frequency range
  50-75 GHz has been developed on Tore Supra to measure electron density
  profiles at the edge. The system uses extraordinary mode polarization
  and performs routine measurements in 20 $\mu$s with heterodyne
  detection to ensure a high dynamic range sensitivity. It allows
  separate phase and amplitude information of the signal. The density
  profiles are fully automatically calculated from the raw phase. The
  initialization is done with automatic detection of the first cut-off
  from the amplitude of the reflected signal with an accuracy of up to
  $\pm$0.5 cm. The profiles are now part of the public database of Tore
  Supra and can provide details of density structures better than the
  centimetre range. The high reliability of the measurements for various
  plasma conditions make this diagnostic an ideal tool to study specific
  edge plasma physics with given examples on detached plasma behaviour
  and antenna-plasma coupling processes for ion cyclotron resonant
  frequency and lower hybrid heating powers. It also is shown how the
  presence of suprathermal electrons may perturb the measurements.}

  abstract={Results of stability analysis are presented for two types of
  plasma with good confinement: internal transport barriers (ITBs) on
  Tore Supra and the radiative improved (RI) mode on TEXTOR. The
  stability analysis has been performed with an electrostatic linear
  gyrokinetic code, evaluating the growth rates of
  microinstabilities. The code developed, KINEZERO, is aimed at
  systematic microstability analysis. Therefore the trade-off between
  having perfect quantitative agreement and minimizing computation time
  is made in favour of the latter. In the plasmas analysed, it is found
  that the onset of the confinement improvement involves a trigger. For
  the ITB discharges, negative magnetic shear is involved, whereas for
  the RI discharges, the triggering role is played by the increase of
  the impurity concentration. Once the improved confinement is
  triggered, the simultaneous increases of temperature and density
  gradients imply an increase in both the growth rate and the rotation
  shearing rate. The rotation shear is found to be high enough to
  maintain an improved confinement through the stabilization of the
  large scale modes.}

  abstract={The condition of the latest version of the ELMy H-mode
  database has been re-examined. It is shown that there is bias in the
  ordinary least squares regression for some of the variables. To
  address these shortcomings three different techniques are employed:
  (a) principal component regression, (b) an error in variables
  technique and (c) the selection of a better conditioned dataset with
  fewer variables. Scalings in terms of the dimensionless physics
  variables, as well as the standard set of engineering variables, are
  also derived. The new scalings give a very similar performance for
  existing scalings for ITER at the standard bn of 1.6, but a much
  improved performance at higher bn.}

                   extract the radial profile of the density
                   fluctuations from the fast swept reflectometry phase
                   signal is proposed and tested on Tore Supra
                   (TS). The relationship between the wavenumber
                   spectrum of the set of phase perturbations obtained
                   during a frequency sweep and the wavenumber spectrum
                   of the turbulence itself is the aim of the
                   method. This relationship can be derived
                   analytically for the O-mode. For the X-mode it is
                   established by full wave simulations. As a result,
                   the radial profile of density fluctuations can be
                   obtained from a mere integration of the wavenumber
                   spectrum of the phase fluctuations. The assumptions
                   used to establish this diagnostics and its
                   limitations are discussed by using simulations. Then
                   the method is applied to recover the radial profile
                   of the density fluctuations in the cases of the TS
                   fast swept reflectometer data. With this method, the
                   expected density profile evolution as a function of
                   the plasma current is clearly shown. }

  abstract={The problem of the collisional evolution of fast-ion guiding centre orbits in magnetically confined plasmas is analysed in great detail. Regimes where the radial excursion of a particle orbit from a given magnetic surface is large compared with its minimum distance from the magnetic axis are specifically addressed. These non-standard orbits give rise to new interesting effects. For instance, the time scale for precessional and bounce motions become comparable, which may have important consequences for plasma stability. Inward orbit drifts and diamagnetic current effects are amplified in the non-standard orbit regime. The neo-classical bootstrap current does not vanish on the magnetic axis, opening the possibility of entirely non-inductive tokamak operation. Non-standard fast ion orbits could also significantly affect the power deposition profile of waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies launched into the plasma for heating purposes. The analysis in this paper is based on a combination of analytical and numerical methods for the solution of the relevant Hamiltonian dynamical system and associated Fokker-Planck equation.}

                  triggering of internal transport barriers (ITBs). The dependence of the turbulent particle pinch velocity on plasma parameters has been clarified and compared with experiment. Magnetic shear and collisionality are found to play a central role. Analysis of heat transport has made progress along two directions: dimensionless scaling laws, which are found to agree with the prediction for electrostatic turbulence, and analysis of modulation experiments, which provide a stringent test of transport models. Finally the formation of ITBs has been addressed by analysing electron transport barriers. It is confirmed that negative magnetic shear, combined with the Shafranov shift, is a robust stabilizing mechanism. However, some well established features of internal barriers are not explained by theory.}

  abstract={Results on confinement and turbulence from a set of Ohmic discharges in TORE SUPRA are discussed. Attention is focused on the saturation of the energy confinement time and it is emphasized that this saturation can be explained by a saturation of the electron heat diffusivity. The ion behaviour is indeed governed by dilution and equipartition effects. Although the ion heat transport is never neoclassical, there is no enhanced degradation at saturation. This behaviour is confirmed by turbulence measurements using CO2 laser coherent scattering. The level of density fluctuations follows the electron heat diffusivity variations with the average density. Waves propagating in the ion diamagnetic direction are always present in turbulence frequency spectra. Thus, the saturation cannot be explained by the onset of an ion turbulence. The existence of ion turbulence in the edge at all densities cannot be excluded. However, this ion feature in scattering spectra could be explained by a Doppler shift associated with an inversion point of the radial electric field at the edge}

  abstract={An explicit integral representation is derived for the tangent of the phase shift due to one-dimensional (1D) scattering of an S-polarized, O-mode, electromagnetic field from a localized wavepacket sitting on top of an inhomogeneous plasma. A Green function technique is used in the derivation together with the Born approximation. The integral representation is evaluated using asymptotic techniques and Bragg resonance is seen to be the dominant mechanism producing the phase shifts due to fluctuations with wavelengths that are short compared to the Airy length. By suitably normalizing the governing differential equation, we have identified the two dominant parameters that control the approximations in our analysis. These are delta n/n0 and kf. The first is the magnitude of the maximum density fluctuation multiplied by the square of the dimensionless length scale that characterizes both the background plasma density profile (with scalelength L) and the incoming microwave field (with vacuum wavenumber k0): delta n/n0 identical to ( delta n/n0)*(k0L)23/. The second is the fluctuation wavenumber normalized to k0 and scaled by the similarly normalized Airy wavenumber: kf identical to (kf/k0)*(k0L)13/. The Born approximation is expected to be valid as long as delta n/n0$<$1, and the Bragg resonance picture dominates as long as kf$>$1.}

It provides a simple tool for analyzing the localization of scattering and defining which turbulence wavenumbers are at the origin of the observed scattered signal.

  abstract={In the edge plasma of the ASDEX tokamak, electrostatic fluctuations were observed with Langmuir probes and in Halpha light with high poloidal and temporal resolution. These fluctuations contribute a significant fraction to the 'anomalous' radial particle transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The basic properties and the dependence of the fluctuation parameters on the discharge conditions are documented. A model for an instability mechanism specific to the SOL is introduced and the experimentally observed fluctuation parameters are compared with the predictions of the linearized version of this model. For plasma temperatures above approximately 10 eV in the SOL the observed parameter dependences of the fluctuations are well reproduced by the model. By mixing length arguments the radial transport and the resulting density and pressure gradients in the SOL are estimated from the model. Their dependence on plasma temperature and density qualitatively agrees with the behaviour observed in ohmic discharges on ASDEX}

Simulations of TFTR plasma with internal transport barriers are presented and compared with one-dimensional full-wave simulations. It is shown that the two-dimensional simulations are remarkably similar to the results of the one-dimensional full-wave analysis for a wide range of turbulent correlation lengths.

  abstract={Examination of radial electric field ( E r ) profiles in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and JET revealed large discrepancies between 2D fluid edge modelling and experiment. Experimental profiles of plasma potential ( V p ) in the outer (low field) side of the plasma, obtained with reciprocating Langmuir probes, decay radially with electron temperature, T e , with the − eE r /∇ T e ratio being > 1.5. In contrast, code simulated E r are fairly low in most of the SOL (compared with −∇ T e / e ). Modelling with kinetic treatment of neutrals and drifts was performed using the SOLPS code for AUG cases and EDGE2D-Nimbus for JET cases. Mismatches between modelled and experimental E r may be caused by the recently established tendency for the SOLPS code to underestimate T e in the divertor of AUG. It was attributed to non-locality of parallel transport of supra-thermal, heat-carrying electrons originating upstream of the divertor, which are usually only weakly collisional and can penetrate, with few collisions, to the target. Ratios − eE r /∇ T e obtained from the probe measurements in JET are of order 1.6, while in AUG, JT-60U and TCV they are of order 3. Such high values point to the possibility of fast electrons contributing, apart from target heat fluxes, also to the formation of the Debye sheath. The problem of the underestimation of E r in the codes must be closely related with the well-known problem of the underestimation of those parts of parallel ion flows in the SOL that are influenced by the toroidal field direction. It was demonstrated earlier that parallel ion flow at the outer midplane is dominated by the ion Pfirsch–Schlüter flow, which in turn is partly driven by the radial electric field. The T e and E r discrepancies, as well as discrepancies between simulated and experimental parallel ion flows, raise a question of the validity of fluid codes for the plasma edge modelling and prompt the inclusion of kinetic effects into present-day 2D fluid codes which assume strong collisionality.}

Abstract = {{One of the scientific success stories of fusion research over the past
   decade is the development of the ExB shear stabilization model to
   explain the formation of transport barriers in magnetic confinement
   devices. This model was originally developed to explain the transport
   barrier formed at the plasma edge in tokamaks after the L (low) to H
   (high) transition. This concept has the universality needed to explain
   the edge transport barriers seen in limiter and divertor tokamaks,
   stellarators, and mirror machines. More recently, this model has been
   applied to explain the further confinement improvement from H (high)
   mode to VH (very high) mode seen in some tokamaks, where the edge
   transport barrier becomes wider. Most recently, this paradigm has been
   applied to the core transport barriers formed in plasmas with negative
   or low magnetic shear in the plasma core. These examples of confinement
   improvement are of considerable physical interest; it is not often that
   a system self-organizes to a higher energy state with reduced turbulence
   and transport when an additional source of free energy is applied to it.
   The transport decrease that is associated with ExB velocity shear
   effects also has significant practical consequences for fusion research.
   The fundamental physics involved in transport reduction is the effect of
   ExB shear on the growth, radial extent, and phase correlation of
   turbulent eddies in the plasma. The same fundamental transport reduction
   process can be operational in various portions of the plasma because
   there are a number of ways to change the radial electric field E-r. An
   important theme in this area is the synergistic effect of ExB velocity
   shear and magnetic shear. Although the ExB velocity shear appears to
   have an effect on broader classes of microturbulence, magnetic shear can
   mitigate some potentially harmful effects of ExB velocity shear and
   facilitate turbulence stabilization. Considerable experimental work has
   been done to test this picture of ExB velocity shear effects on
   turbulence; the experimental results are generally consistent with the
   basic theoretical models. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Local edge parameters on the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak are investigated at
   the L-mode to H-mode transition, during phases with various types of
   edge-localized modes (ELMs), and at the density limit. A scaling law for
   the boundary electron temperature, T-e,b(thresh) proportional to
   n(e,b)(-0.3) B-t(0.8) I-p(0.5), is found which describes the H-mode
   threshold for deuterium-puffed discharges with favourable ion del
   B-drift direction. The region of stable operation is bounded by type I
   ELMs near the ideal ballooning limit and by a minimum temperature
   necessary to avoid thermal instability of the plasma edge. Stationary
   operation with type III ELMs imposes an upper limit on the edge
   temperature. Within the entire range of boundary densities investigated
   (n(e,b) less than or equal to 8 x 10(19) m(-3)), both L-mode and H-mode
   are found to be accessible. During type I ELMy H-mode, a relation of
   global confinement with the edge pressure gradient is found which is
   connected with a loss of the favourable density dependence predicted by
   the 1TER-92P and ITER-93H ELMy H-mode scalings. At high density, better
   confinement is achieved in H-modes with an edge pressure gradient below
   the ideal ballooning limit, e.g. during type III ELMy H-mode with
   impurity-seeded radiation.}},

  abstract={Understanding the processes which establish the H-mode edge transport barrier (ETB) and the scaling of those processes with the plasma properties local to the plasma edge is of critical importance for optimizing the performance of power-station scale fusion plasmas. In this paper, data from 67 JET pulses were assembled and classified by confinement mode. A neural network classification technique was applied to identify the nature of the dependence of the L–H boundary on plasma parameters local to the plasma edge. Strong dependences on T e , n e , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} B ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} and a weak dependence on q 80 were found. In applying the neural network model as a confinement mode identification tool, the correct operating mode was identified for 98.86% of the time slices in a test data set. Using an extended data set the boundary predictions from five theoretical ETB models were evaluated. These models consider a range of different physical processes for the ETB. One model was clearly rejected. While other models proved more favourable, none of the tested models robustly described the JET L–H boundary.}

  abstract={The understanding and predictive capability of transport physics and plasma confinement is reviewed from the perspective of achieving reactor-scale burning plasmas in the ITER tokamak, for both core and edge plasma regions. Very considerable progress has been made in understanding, controlling and predicting tokamak transport across a wide variety of plasma conditions and regimes since the publication of the ITER Physics Basis (IPB) document ( 1999 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/39/12/301] 39 2137–2664 ). Major areas of progress considered here follow. (1) Substantial improvement in the physics content, capability and reliability of transport simulation and modelling codes, leading to much increased theory/experiment interaction as these codes are increasingly used to interpret and predict experiment. (2) Remarkable progress has been made in developing and understanding regimes of improved core confinement. Internal transport barriers and other forms of reduced core transport are now routinely obtained in all the leading tokamak devices worldwide. (3) The importance of controlling the H-mode edge pedestal is now generally recognized. Substantial progress has been made in extending high confinement H-mode operation to the Greenwald density, the demonstration of Type I ELM mitigation and control techniques and systematic explanation of Type I ELM stability. Theory-based predictive capability has also shown progress by integrating the plasma and neutral transport with MHD stability. (4) Transport projections to ITER are now made using three complementary approaches: empirical or global scaling, theory-based transport modelling and dimensionless parameter scaling (previously, empirical scaling was the dominant approach). For the ITER base case or the reference scenario of conventional ELMy H-mode operation, all three techniques predict that ITER will have sufficient confinement to meet its design target of Q = 10 operation, within similar uncertainties.}

  abstract={The physical transport processes at the basis of JET typical inductive H-mode scenarios and advanced hybrid regimes, with improved thermal confinement, are analyzed by means of some of the newest and more sophisticated quasi-linear transport models: trapped gyro Landau fluid (TGLF) and QuaLiKiz. The temporal evolution of JET pulses is modelled by CRONOS where the turbulent transport is modelled by either QuaLiKiz or TGLF. Both are first principle models with a more comprehensive physics than the models previously developed and therefore allow the analysis of the physics at the basis of the investigated scenarios. For H-modes, ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes are found to be dominant and the transport models are able to properly reproduce temperature profiles in self-consistent simulations. However, for hybrid regimes, in addition to ITG trapped electron modes (TEM) are also found to be important and different physical mechanisms for turbulence reduction play a decisive role. Whereas E × B flow shear and plasma geometry have a limited impact on turbulence, the presence of a large population of fast ions, quite important in low density regimes, can stabilize core turbulence mainly when the electromagnetic effects are taken into account. The TGLF transport model properly captures these mechanisms and correctly reproduces temperatures.}

  abstract={The prediction of impurity peaking in future fusion devices such as ITER necessitates the study of the dependence on Z of the impurity transport in present devices. In this paper we describe a novel technique to determine the transport of impurities with different atomic numbers independently. A technique has been developed that allows simultaneously the measurement of the transport of Ne and Ar in the same discharge while minimizing the systematic errors in the spectroscopic measurements. The reproduction of the charge-exchange measured densities, absolute vaccum ultra-violet line intensities and absolute soft x-ray intensity is achieved in an impurity transport simulation. The method used to estimate the errors on the transport coefficients of neon (Ne) and argon (Ar) is presented. In the plasma region where the diffusion and convection coefficients are determined for hybrid discharges, the transport of Ne and Ar is observed to exceed neoclassical predictions. In the same regions, the diffusion coefficients of both impurities are similar. The convection coefficients are also comparable for Ne and Ar. The peaking of Ne and Ar density profiles are comparable during the period where the intermittent slow reconnecting n = 1 mode is stable in these hybrid discharges.}

  abstract={A transport code (TRANSP) is used to simulate future deuterium-tritium (DT) experiments in TFTR. The simulations are derived from 14 TFTR DD discharges, and the modelling of one supershot is discussed in detail to indicate the degree of accuracy of the TRANSP modelling. Fusion energy yields and alpha particle parameters are calculated, including profiles of the alpha slowing down time, the alpha average energy, and the Alfven speed and frequency. Two types of simulation are discussed. The main emphasis is on the DT equivalent, where an equal mix of D and T is substituted for the D in the initial target plasma, and for the D 0 in the neutral beam injection, but the other measured beam and plasma parameters are unchanged. This simulation does not assume that alpha heating will enhance the plasma parameters or that confinement will increase with the addition of tritium. The maximum relative fusion yield calculated for these simulations is Q DT ~ 0.3, and the maximum alpha contribution to the central toroidal β is β α (0) ~ 0.5%. The stability of toroidicity induced Alfven eigenmodes (TAE) and kinetic ballooning modes (KBM) is discussed. The TAE mode is predicted to become unstable for some of the simulations, particularly after the termination of neutral beam injection. In the second type of simulation, empirical supershot scaling relations are used to project the performance at the maximum expected beam power. The MHD stability of the simulations is discussed}

The mechanism of ITB sustainment was analysed. Modelling of the plasma heating and current profile was done using the TRANSP and JETTO transport codes. The resulting q-profile evolution was verified by comparison with the pitch angle delta = B-p/B-t deduced from motional Stark effect measurements (where B-p and B-t are the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field, respectively). Turbulence stability was analysed using the gyro-kinetic code Kinezero. It was shown that the strong negative magnetic shear produced by LHCD and sustained mainly by the bootstrap current in the plasma core is responsible for the turbulence stabilization. Stabilization due to shear of the plasma rotation and finite beta-stabilization play a complimentary role. The effect of bootstrap and LH driven currents on magnetic shear in JET discharges was analysed.},

abstract = "A pedagogical review of the historical development and current status (as of early 2000) of systematic statistical theories of plasma turbulence is undertaken. Emphasis is on conceptual foundations and methodology, not practical applications. Particular attention is paid to equations and formalism appropriate to strongly magnetized, fully ionized plasmas. Extensive reference to the literature on neutral-fluid turbulence is made, but the unique properties and problems of plasmas are emphasized throughout. Discussions are given of quasilinear theory, weak-turbulence theory, resonance-broadening theory, and the clump algorithm. The direct-interaction approximation (DIA) is developed as a central focus of the article, and its relationship to the earlier plasma theories is explained. Various methods of renormalized perturbation theory are described, then unified with the aid of the generating-functional formalism of Martin, Siggia, and Rose. A general expression for the renormalized dielectric function is deduced and discussed in detail. Modern approaches such as decimation and \{PDF\} methods are described. Derivations of DIA-based Markovian closures are discussed. The eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure is shown to be nonrealizable in the presence of waves, and a new realizable Markovian closure is presented. The test-field model and a realizable modification thereof are also summarized. Numerical solutions of various closures for some plasma-physics paradigms are reviewed. The variational approach to bounds on transport is developed. Miscellaneous topics include Onsager symmetries for turbulence, the interpretation of entropy balances for both kinetic and fluid descriptions, self-organized criticality, statistical interactions between disparate scales, and the roles of both mean and random shear. Appendices are provided on Fourier transform conventions, dimensional and scaling analysis, the derivations of nonlinear gyrokinetic and gyrofluid equations, stochasticity criteria for quasilinear theory, formal aspects of resonance-broadening theory, Novikov's theorem, the treatment of weak inhomogeneity, the derivation of the Vlasov and gyrokinetic weak-turbulence wave kinetic equation from a fully renormalized description, some features of a code for solving the \{DIA\} and related Markovian closures, the details of the solution of the \{EDQNM\} closure for a solvable three-wave model, and the notation used in the article.

  abstract={A collective infra-red laser scattering diagnostic has been installed on the TORE SUPRA tokamak for the measurement of plasma density fluctuations. For the range of wavenumbers explored (3-15 cm -1 ), the scattering angles are very weak ( approximately 1 mrad). Consequently, the scattering signals are averaged along the whole observation chord, resulting in poor longitudinal spatial localization. By virtue of the pitch angle variation of the magnetic field lines in the tokamak, and of the perpendicularity of the turbulence wavevector to these field lines, it has been possible to obtain partial spatial resolution along the direction of the beam. Good agreement between the experimental and theoretical angular resolution of the diagnostic as well as the results of cross-correlation performed on the signals obtained by two simultaneous probing beams also justify this novel concept.}

The impurity confinement times τ p , which reflect the impurity transport, have been measured by fitting exponential curves to the decays of the central brightnesses. Two databases are built up, including ohmic and L mode discharges, with the aim of determining a τ p scaling law common to both devices. Different monomial scaling laws are tested and the best one is chosen on the basis of minimization of the standard deviation of the individual regressions. Moreover, the impurity confinement times are compared with the energy confinement times τ E for the same data. The energy confinement times are larger than the impurity confinement times, the average ratio tau E/τ p being approximately 2.5}

For the elements Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe the diffusion coefficient in the centre is D ≤ 6 × 10 -2 m 2 /s and rises with the radial distance from the centre. With increasing Z number the transport becomes strongly convective with inward directed drift velocities that produce very peaked impurity densities for high Z. The inward drift decreases with decreasing deuterium density gradient. Neoclassical transport of the impurities has been calculated numerically. The calculated diffusion coefficient and drift velocity are close to the experimental values for the lower-Z elements Ne and Ar. However, for high Z, the calculated diffusion coefficient is smaller by a factor of up to 2.5 and the inward drift velocity is too small by a factor of 10. Toroidal rotation of the plasma that leads to an increased impurity density on the outboard side of the flux surfaces is not taken into account by the neoclassical calculations. Inboard/outboard asymmetries are not present for Ar and Ne with toroidal Mach number M tor around 1. However, for heavier elements than Kr with M tor ≈ 2 and an outboard/inboard ratio of ≈ 1.5, poloidal variation of the impurity density is important and might account for the discrepancy between the measured and calculated transport coefficients.}

  abstract={The behaviour of tungsten in the core of hybrid scenario plasmas in JET with the ITER-like wall is analysed and modelled with a combination of neoclassical and gyrokinetic codes. In these discharges, good confinement conditions can be maintained only for the first 2–3 s of the high power phase. Later W accumulation is regularly observed, often accompanied by the onset of magneto-hydrodynamical activity, in particular neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs), both of which have detrimental effects on the global energy confinement. The dynamics of the accumulation process is examined, taking into consideration the concurrent evolution of the background plasma profiles, and the possible onset of NTMs. Two time slices of a representative discharge, before and during the accumulation process, are analysed with two independent methods, in order to reconstruct the W density distribution over the poloidal cross-section. The same time slices are modelled, computing both neoclassical and turbulent transport components and consistently including the impact of centrifugal effects, which can be significant in these plasmas, and strongly enhance W neoclassical transport. The modelling closely reproduces the observations and identifies inward neoclassical convection due to the density peaking of the bulk plasma in the central region as the main cause of the accumulation. The change in W neoclassical convection is directly produced by the transient behaviour of the main plasma density profile, which is hollow in the central region in the initial part of the high power phase of the discharge, but which develops a significant density peaking very close to the magnetic axis in the later phase. The analysis of a large set of discharges provides clear indications that this effect is generic in this scenario. The unfavourable impact of the onset of NTMs on the W behaviour, observed in several discharges, is suggested to be a consequence of a detrimental combination of the effects of neoclassical transport and of the appearance of an island.}

  abstract={Impurity transport coefficients due to ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) mode and trapped-electron mode turbulence are calculated using profile data from dedicated impurity injection experiments at JET. Results obtained with a multi-fluid model are compared with quasi-linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation results obtained with the code GENE. The sign of the impurity convective velocity (pinch) and its various contributions are discussed. The dependence of the impurity transport coefficients and impurity peaking factor −∇ n Z / n Z on plasma parameters such as impurity charge number Z , ion logarithmic temperature gradient, collisionality, E × B shearing, and charge fraction are investigated. It is found that for the studied ITG dominated JET discharges, both the fluid and gyrokinetic results show an increase in the impurity peaking factor for low Z -values followed by a saturation at moderate values of impurity peaking, much below the neoclassical predictions, for large values of Z . The results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental trends observed for the injected impurities (Ne, Ar, Ni) whereas for the background carbon species the observed flat or weakly hollow C profiles are not well reproduced by the simulations.}

  abstract={Numerical studies of neoclassical transport, beginning with the fundamental drift-kinetic equation (DKE), have been extended to include the self-consistent coupling of electrons and multiple ion species. The code, NEO, provides a first-principles based calculation of the neoclassical transport coefficients directly from solution of the distribution function by solving a hierarchy of equations derived by expanding the DKE in powers of ρ * i , the ratio of the ion gyroradius to system size. This includes the calculation of the first-order electrostatic potential via the Poisson equation, although this potential has exactly no effect on the steady-state transport. Systematic calculations of the second-order particle and energy fluxes and first-order plasma flows and bootstrap current and comparisons with existing theories are given for multi-species plasmas. The ambipolar relation ∑ a z a Γ a = 0, which can only be maintained with complete cross-species collisional coupling, is confirmed, and finite mass-ratio corrections due to the collisional coupling are identified. The effects of plasma shaping are also explored, including a discussion of how analytic formulae obtained for circular plasmas (i.e. Chang–Hinton) should be applied to shaped cases. Finite-orbit-width effects are studied via solution of the higher-order DKEs and the implications of non-local transport on the validity of the δ f formulation are discussed.}

Global data, for the energy confinement time and its controlling parameters, have now been collected from 18 machines of different sizes and shapes: ASDEX, ASDEX Upgrade, C-Mod, COMPASS-D, DIII-D, JET, JFT-2M, JT-60U, MAST, NSTX, PBX-M, PDX, START, T-10, TCV, TdeV, TFTR and TUMAN-3M. The database now contains 10382 data entries from 3762 plasma discharges, including data from deuterium–tritium experiments, low-aspect ratio plasmas, dimensionless parameter experiments and plasmas. DB3 also contains an increased amount of data from a range of diverted machines and further data at high triangularity, high density and high current. A wide range of physics studies has been performed on DB3 with particular progress made in the separation of core and edge behaviour, dimensionless parameter analyses and the comparison of the database with one-dimensional transport codes. The errors in the physics variables of the database have also been studied and this has led to the use of errors in variables fits. A key aim of the database has always been to provide a basis for estimating the energy confinement properties of next step machines such as ITER, and so the impact of the database and its analysis on such machines is also discussed.}

Density profiles are monotonically peaked at negative shear. Since density profiles remain peaked at zero loop voltage and negligible core particle source, the effect is attributed to an anomalous process of inward convection. No significant evidence was found for a correlation of density peaking with collisionality, nor of a dependence on temperature peaking within the parameter range investigated. The peaking of the temperature profiles and of the current profiles is uncorrelated in this dataset, allowing, for the first time, an experimental distinction between their effects on the density profile. The results are supportive of theories explaining particle convection by the anomalous curvature pinch or turbulent equipartition by trapped electrons, rather than by anomalous thermodiffusion.}

Unlike previous studies, this work focuses on low collisionality data as most representative of reactor conditions. The study confirms that collisionality is the most important parameter governing density peaking in H-mode, followed by the NBI particle flux and/or the T i / T e temperature ratio. For the first time in JET a modest, albeit significant dependence of peaking on internal inductance, or magnetic shear is seen. The experimental behaviour is compared with an extensive database of linear gyrokinetic calculations using the GS2 code. The predictions from GS2 simulations based on the highest linear growth rate mode are in good agreement with experimental observations. They are also corroborated by initial results from the non-linear code GYRO.}

  abstract={For the first time, scalings for density peaking in tokamaks are obtained from a database consisting of observations from two devices, ASDEX Upgrade and JET. The investigation relies on an inversion method for the interferometer signals which grants consistent reconstructions despite differences in interferometer geometries. By combining observations from these devices, correlations between physics parameters investigated for their role in determining density peaking are reduced. Multiple regression analyses show that in the combined database collisionality is the most relevant parameter. The particle source provided by neutral beam injection provides a contribution to the peaking, which, although not negligible, is not large enough to explain the whole observed variation of density peaking. The device size, introduced as an alias for possible systematic differences between the devices not captured by the regression parameters, is found to play only a small role in regressions which include collisionality. Device size becomes relevant in scalings which exclude collisionality and include the ratio of the density to the Greenwald density limit. This indicates that density peaking is more likely to be a function of collisionality rather than of the fraction of the density limit. All the scalings which include collisionality in the regression variables predict a peaked density profile for the ITER standard scenario.}

In particular, the spatial structure and wave number spectra of various fluctuating plasma quantities are presented and discussed. An analysis of several cross phase relations supports the view that the transport-dominating scales may be interpreted in terms of remnants of linear modes. In a few test cases, zonal flows are artificially suppressed, demonstrating that their influence on the transport level is small. Finally, the dependence of the latter on several plasma parameters is studied.},

@article{Cla01,
abstract = {A broadband reflectometer operating in the frequency range
50-75 GHz has been developed on Tore Supra to measure electron density
profiles at the edge. The system uses extraordinary mode polarization
and performs routine measurements in 20 $\mu$s with heterodyne
detection to ensure a high dynamic range sensitivity. It allows
separate phase and amplitude information of the signal. The density
profiles are fully automatically calculated from the raw phase. The
initialization is done with automatic detection of the first cut-off
from the amplitude of the reflected signal with an accuracy of up to
$\backslash$pm0.5 cm. The profiles are now part of the public database of Tore
Supra and can provide details of density structures better than the
centimetre range. The high reliability of the measurements for various
plasma conditions make this diagnostic an ideal tool to study specific
edge plasma physics with given examples on detached plasma behaviour
and antenna-plasma coupling processes for ion cyclotron resonant
frequency and lower hybrid heating powers. It also is shown how the
presence of suprathermal electrons may perturb the measurements.},

  abstract={The ITER Threshold Database, which at present comprises data from nine divertor tokamaks, is described. The main results are presented and discussed. The properties and dependences of the power threshold in individual devices are reviewed. In particular, the analysis shows a rather general linear dependence on magnetic field, but a non-monotonic density dependence that varies from device to device. Investigation of the combined database suggests that the threshold dependence P thres approximately=0.3n e B T 2.5 shows reasonable agreement with the data. This expression yields P thres approximately=150 MW at a density of 0.5*10 20 m -3 for ITER. Other expressions with weaker size dependence, and therefore lower threshold power for ITER, are also discussed. Their agreement with the present data is poorer than that of the above expression. In addition, the database is investigated by statistical discriminant analysis. The edge data included at present are described and discussed. Finally, there is a discussion of the implications of the results for ITER}

  abstract={The characteristics of the edge radial electric field ( E r ) are studied in deuterium, hydrogen and helium plasmas at ASDEX Upgrade. The minimum of the E r well is analyzed as a function of pedestal parameters and the best correlation is found between the depth of the E r well and the ion pressure at the pedestal top. This result is consistent with E r being balanced by the main ion pressure gradient term. Studying the radial position of the E r minimum reveals that the E r well moves closer to the last closed flux surface the deeper the E r well is. This suggests that for deeper E r wells the distance between the steepest gradients in the ion temperature and ion density profile is reduced. The width of the E r well shows no significant variations despite changing the ion temperature, magnetic field and plasma particle species. At AUG, the E r well is on average 1.2 cm wide. A multi-machine comparison supports a machine size scaling of E r and indicates that the E r shear layer covers the outer 2% of the plasma minor radius independent of the size of the machine. Based on this scaling, the width of the E r well in ITER is estimated to ∼4 cm.}

  abstract={Experiments have been performed on ASDEX Upgrade to clarify the nature of the radial electric field, E r , in the edge transport barrier of tokamak plasmas. Highly resolved radial profiles of E r have been diagnosed spectroscopically through the radial force balance of impurity ions. We show that in the fully developed, highly collisional edge pedestal the nature of the radial electric field is neoclassical. This requires, in particular, that the main ion poloidal rotation is at neoclassical levels. Both main ion and impurity ion poloidal rotation profiles have been measured in deuterium, hydrogen and helium plasmas with main ion pedestal top collisionalities, ν *,i , between 1.2 and 12. These profiles have been compared to a hierarchy of neoclassical models (from a conventional description to a comprehensive model including finite orbit width effects). They are found, in all cases, to be in good agreement demonstrating that inside the edge transport barrier the E r well is sustained by the gradients of the main ion species.}

  abstract={Experimental investigations carried out in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak under various conditions demonstrate that the ion heat flux at the plasma edge plays a key role in the L–H transition physics, while the electron heat flux does not seem to play any role. This is due to the fact that the ion heat flux governs the radial electric field well induced by the main ions which is responsible for the turbulence stabilization causing the L–H transition. The experiments have been carried out in the low density branch of the power threshold where the electron and ion heat channels can be well separated. In plasmas heated by electron heating, the edge ion heat flux has been increased to reach the L–H transition by using separately three actuators: heating power, density and plasma current. In addition, the key role of the edge ion heating has been confirmed in experiments taking advantage of the direct ion heating provided by neutral beam injection. The role of the ion heat flux explains the non-monotonic density dependence of the L–H threshold power. Based on these results, a formula for the density of the threshold minimum has been developed, which also describes well the values found in tokamaks of various size. For ITER it predicts a value which is close to the density presently foreseen to enter the H-mode and indicates that operation at half field and current would benefit from a very significantly lower density minimum and correspondingly low threshold power.}

Results on the first systematic measurements of the power necessary for the transition of the plasma to the type I ELM regime, which occurs after the transition to H mode, are also in agreement with the A eff -1 scaling. For a subset of discharges, measurements of T e and T i at the top of the profile pedestal have been obtained, indicating a weak influence of the isotopic mass on the critical edge temperature thought to be necessary for the H mode transition.}

Shear in the E*B flow of the fluctuations in the plasma edge can lead to decorrelation of the fluctuations, decreased radial correlation lengths and reduced turbulent transport. Changes in the radial electric field, the density fluctuations and the edge transport consistent with shear stabilization of turbulence have been seen in several tokamaks. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the most recent data in the light of the basic paradigm of electric field shear stabilization and to critically compare the experimental results with various theories.}

  abstract={The turbulent flux of momentum—or Reynolds stress—is a mechanism responsible for the generation of sheared flow by turbulence. The structure of the flux-surface-averaged stress ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/10/103013/nf418319ieqn001.gif] {$\langle \tilde{v}_r \tilde{v}_{\bot} \rangle$} is investigated in the edge region of an L-mode tokamak plasma. The stress induced by the perpendicular tilting of ballooning modes is considered. In addition to the tilting by the E × B flow shear, which is a negative viscosity effect, a magnetic-shear-induced Reynolds stress—called ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/10/103013/nf418319ieqn002.gif] {$\hat{s}$} -residual stress—arises as a consequence of a residual spatial tilting of ballooning modes by the magnetic shear in a poloidally up–down asymmetric magnetic geometry. A model is derived in the weak flow shear regime under the approximation of circular flux surfaces. The amplitude of this residual stress is of the order of the square of the radial velocity fluctuations in the scrape-off layer (SOL), and in the immediate radial vicinity of the separatrix if an X-point exists. Its amplitude drops rapidly to zero towards the plasma core, thus appearing as a source of transverse rotation at the interface. Its non-linear dependence on the electric shear is discussed in the context of the weak electric shear effect on the poloidal shape of the ballooning envelope. The local ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/52/10/103013/nf418319ieqn002.gif] {$\hat{s}$} -residual stress is non-uniform poloidally and changes sign according to the up/down position of SOL end-plates with respect to the ∇ B × B direction. The electric- and magnetic-shear-induced stresses are then included in a flux-surface-averaged 1D model of mean flow conservation at the plasma edge, including the SOL volume. In L-mode weak shear regimes, it is shown that changing the plasma geometry from ∇ B × B away from the divertor to ∇ B × B towards the divertor approximately doubles the electric shear strength inside the separatrix, as reported in experiments. This shear-induced stress also enters the toroidal momentum balance, where it appears as a significant source of momentum in the immediate vicinity of the separatrix. Balanced by the toroidal viscosity only, it can sustain toroidal flow gradients of the order of a km s −1 cm −1 at the separatrix, with a sign also dependent on the plasma geometry. These momentum sources arising from symmetry breaking at the boundary of the confined region may explain why low to high mode power thresholds are lower in favourable than unfavourable configurations, and may be important for the issue of optimal plasma shapes with respect to edge intrinsic shear.}

The generalization allows a fast numerical implementation of a certain two-dimensional integral that appears in the description of the plasma dispersion in curved geometry, by reducing it to a single integral over a function involving the generalized plasma dispersion function. The local dielectric function of the toroidal ion temperature gradient driven mode can be written in terms of these integral functions. A matrix method is proposed to combine the consecutive integrals as a single 1D integral over a single integrand. The method allows two orders of magnitude speed up over the 2D integral implementation. Using various optimizations and an efficient implementation of the regular plasma dispersion function, further speed up is obtained. "

  abstract={The build-up of plasma parameters following the H-mode transition in JET has been analysed in view of its consequences for the alpha power evolution in the access to burning plasma conditions in ITER. JET experiments show that the build-up of plasma temperature both at the plasma core and the plasma edge occurs in timescales comparable to the energy confinement time. In contrast, the evolution of the edge and core densities differs strongly depending on the level of plasma current in the discharge and of the associated NBI penetration. For higher plasma current H-mode discharges ( I p > 2.0–2.5 MA, depending on plasma shape), with naturally higher plasma densities for which NBI penetration is poorer, the core density evolves in much longer timescales than the edge density leading to the formation of rather hollow density profiles. These hollow density profiles persist for timescales of several energy confinement times until they are usually terminated by a sawtooth. Modelling of the JET experiments with JETTO shows that the density build-up following the H-mode transition can be described with a purely diffusive model, despite the low collisionalities of high current H-mode plasmas at JET. The consequences of these JET experimental/modelling findings for the access to burning plasma conditions in the ITER Q DT = 10 scenario are presented.}

abstract ={In the investigation of stability of a plasma confined by magnetic fields some of the most important modes of oscillation are those with long wavelength parallel to the magnetic field and short wavelength perpendicular to it. However, these characteristics conflict with the requirement of periodicity in a toroidal magnetic field with shear. This conflict can be resolved by transforming the calculation to one in an infinite domain without periodicity constraints. This transformation is the starting point for a full investigation of the magnetohydrodynamic stability of an axisymmetric plasma at large toroidal wave number $n$. (Small values of $n$ can be studied by direct numerical computation but this fails when $n$ is large.) For $n\gg $ 1 there are two distinct length scales in the problem and a systematic approximation is developed around an eikonal representation, formally as an expansion in $1/n$. In lowest order the oscillations of each magnetic surface are decoupled and a local eigenvalue is obtained. However, the mode structure is not fully determined in this lowest order. In higher orders a second eigenvalue equation is obtained which completes the determination of the structure of the mode and relates the local eigenvalue of the lower order theory to the true eigenvalue for the problem. This higher order theory shows that unstable modes are localized in the vicinity of the surface with the smallest local eigenvalue, that the true eigenvalue is close to the lowest local eigenvalue and that the most unstable high $n$ modes occur for $n\rightarrow $ $\infty $. Hence the local theory, which involves no more than the solution of an ordinary differential equation, is normally adequate for the determination of stability of any axisymmetric plasma to high mode number oscillations.},

The peculiarity and interest of exciting these electron fishbones by ECRH only or by LH only is also analysed. Not only is the mode stability explained, but also the transition between steady state nonlinear oscillations to bursting (almost regular) pulsations, as observed in FTU, is interpreted in terms of the LH power input. These results are directly relevant to the investigation of trapped alpha particle interactions with low-frequency MHD modes in burning plasmas: in fact, alpha particles in reactor relevant conditions are characterized by small dimensionless orbits, similarly to electrons; the trapped particle bounce averaged dynamics, meanwhile, depends on energy and not mass.}

  abstract={An extensive database to study the scaling of rotation and momentum transport has been constructed at JET. The database contains information from various operational scenarios, amongst them H-mode discharges, and parameters that characterize the rotation, as well as those that describe the general plasma conditions. JET plasmas are predominantly heated by neutral beam injection which is also the main source for the observed toroidal rotation. Dimensionless Mach numbers are introduced to quantify rotation. The scaling of plasma rotation and the Mach numbers in particular has been studied. The thermal and Alfvén Mach numbers were found to scale inversely with q and with the ratio of torque and additional heating power. Although the momentum and energy confinement times were found to be of the same magnitude, the ratio was found to vary. Regression analyses showed a dependence of both the energy and momentum confinement times on plasma rotation. If rotation was included in the scaling model of energy and momentum confinement the quality of the fits substantially improved. Detailed analysis of the core and edge (pedestal) confinement showed that momentum confinement was improved in the core of the plasma compared with the energy confinement. However, the pedestal proved to be less confining for the momentum than for the energy.}

  abstract={The 1997 DT experiment (DTE1) at the Joint European Torus included studies of the behaviour of alpha particles in high temperature plasmas. Alpha particle heating was clearly observed in a series of 10 MW hot ion H modes by scanning the DT mixture from 0% T to 93% T. Maxima in central temperature and energy content were obtained which corresponded with the maximum in fusion yield. Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs) have been detected in JET, driven by NBI or ICRH fast ions. However, in agreement with theory, no AE activity was observed in DT plasmas which could be attributed to alpha particle drive, except in the afterglow of some optimized shear pulses. Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) was detected at harmonics of the alpha particle cyclotron frequency at the outer edge of the plasma. The ICE is interpreted as being close to magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability, driven by inverted alpha distributions at the plasma edge. The high energy neutral particle spectra showed features which are ascribed to a mixture of alphas, neutralized by helium-like impurities, and deuterons born from elastic collisions with alpha particles and neutralized by hydrogen-like impurities. The results of all these studies are consistent with classical alpha particle trapping and slowing down. Future DT experiments will aim to increase alpha particle pressure so that interactions with plasma instabilities can be studied. The measurement of knock-on neutral triton spectra offers an unambiguous way to determine confined alpha densities in these future experiments.}

  abstract={The global energy confinement of combined ohmic and lower hybrid driven TORE SUPRA plasmas has been analysed at various densities. In contradiction to the L mode ITER scaling law, this analysis indicates that the global energy confinement time depends strongly on the plasma density. Furthermore, the thermal electron energy content of steady state discharges is found to be in good agreement with the global Rebut-Lallia-Watkins (RLW) scaling law. Current ramp experiments show an enhancement of the global energy confinement with the internal inductance, l i . These results have been extended to steady state regimes with lower hybrid current drive. Improved confinement has been obtained in a high l i steady state plasma (l i =1.7), where the modification of the current profile by lower hybrid waves leads to an increase in the central value of the safety factor (qψ(0) ≈ 2). In this case, the global confinement time is shown to exceed the value predicted by the RLW scaling law by 40%}

  abstract={Tokamak discharges with improved energy confinement properties arising from internal transport barriers (ITBs) have certain attractive features, such as a large bootstrap current fraction, which suggest a potential route to the steady-state mode of operation desirable for fusion power plants. This paper first reviews the present state of theoretical and experimental knowledge regarding the formation and characteristics of ITBs in tokamaks. Specifically, the current status of theoretical modelling of ITBs is presented; then, an international ITB database based on experimental information extracted from some nine tokamaks is described and used to draw some general conclusions concerning the necessary conditions for ITBs to appear, comparing these with the theoretical models. The experimental situation regarding the steady-state, or at least quasi-steady-state, operation of tokamaks is reviewed and finally the issues and prospects for achieving such operational modes in ITER are discussed. More detailed information on the characteristics of ITBs in some 13 tokamaks (as well as helical devices) appears in the appendix.}

  abstract={Understanding and modelling turbulent transport in thermonuclear fusion plasmas are crucial for designing and optimizing the operational scenarios of future fusion reactors. In this context, plasmas exhibiting state transitions, such as the formation of an internal transport barrier (ITB), are particularly interesting since they can shed light on transport physics and offer the opportunity to test different turbulence suppression models. In this paper, we focus on the modelling of ITB formation in the Joint European Torus (JET) [1] hybrid-scenario plasmas, where, due to the monotonic safety factor profile, magnetic shear stabilization cannot be invoked to explain the transition. The turbulence suppression mechanism investigated here relies on the increase in the plasma pressure gradient in the presence of a minority of energetic ions. Microstability analysis of the ion temperature gradient driven modes (ITG) in the presence of a fast-hydrogen minority shows that energetic ions accelerated by the ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) system (hydrogen, n H,fast / n D,thermal up to 10%, T H,fast / T D,thermal up to 30) can increase the pressure gradient enough to stabilize the ITG modes driven by the gradient of the thermal ions (deuterium). Numerical analysis shows that, by increasing the temperature of the energetic ions, electrostatic ITG modes are gradually replaced by nearly electrostatic modes with tearing parity at progressively longer wavelengths. The growth rate of the microtearing modes is found to be lower than that of the ITG modes and comparable to the local E × B -velocity shearing rate. The above mechanism is proposed as a possible trigger for the formation of ITBs in this type of discharges.}

  abstract={The trapped gyro-Landau fluid (TGLF) transport model computes the quasilinear particle and energy driftwave fluxes in tokamaks with shaped geometry, finite aspect ratio and collisions. The TGLF particle and energy fluxes have been successfully verified against a large database of collisionless nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations using the GYRO code. Using a new collision model in TGLF, we find remarkable agreement between the TGLF quasilinear fluxes and 64 new GYRO nonlinear simulations with electron–ion collisions. In validating TGLF against DIII-D and JET H-mode and hybrid discharges we find the temperature and density profiles are in excellent agreement with the measured profiles. ITER projections using TGLF show that the fusion gains are somewhat more pessimistic than the previous GLF23 results primarily due to finite aspect ratio effects included only in TGLF. The synergistic effects of density peaking, finite β and E × B shear due to finite toroidal rotation lead to significant increases in fusion power above a reduced physics ITER base case. The TGLF results for ITER are confirmed using nonlinear GYRO simulations in place of TGLF to predict the temperature profiles within the TGYRO transport code. These results represent a snapshot of the ongoing effort to improve the TGLF model, validate it against experimental data, and make predictions for ITER.}

  abstract={Fusion physics poses an extremely challenging, practically complex problem that does not yield readily to simple paradigms. Nevertheless, various of the theoretical tools and conceptual advances emphasized at the KaufmanFest 2007 have motivated and/or found application to the development of fusion-related plasma turbulence theory. A brief historical commentary is given on some aspects of that specialty, with emphasis on the role (and limitations) of Hamiltonian/symplectic approaches, variational methods, oscillation-center theory, and nonlinear dynamics. It is shown how to extract a renormalized ponderomotive force from the statistical equations of plasma turbulence, and the possibility of a renormalized K – χ theorem is discussed. An unusual application of quasilinear theory to the problem of plasma equilibria in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields is described. The modern problem of zonal-flow dynamics illustrates a confluence of several techniques, including (i) the application of nonlinear-dynamics methods, especially center-manifold theory, to the problem of the transition to plasma turbulence in the face of self-generated zonal flows; and (ii) the use of Hamiltonian formalism to determine the appropriate (Casimir) invariant to be used in a novel wave-kinetic analysis of systems of interacting zonal flows and drift waves. Recent progress in the theory of intermittent chaotic statistics and the generation of coherent structures from turbulence is mentioned, and an appeal is made for some new tools to cope with these interesting and difficult problems in nonlinear plasma physics. Finally, the important influence of the intellectually stimulating research environment fostered by Prof. Allan Kaufman on the author's thinking and teaching methodology is described.}

The BPT results are consistent with the ratio-evaluation method (REM) which is used to determine the electron temperature from the ratios of scattering signals. If compared to the sequential REM, the Bayesian error analysis is much more informative because it yields probability density functions of the quantities of interest. Moreover, systematic consideration of all the obtainable raw data, in particular those data suffering from low signal levels, results in an improved evaluation for weakly informative data.

Spatially resolved edge density fluctuation measurements show a change in the poloidal group velocity of the fluctuations when the ∇ B drift direction was changed, even though the edge profiles of density and temperature remained nearly the same. High (low) shear in the poloidal velocity is associated with a low (high) power threshold.}

Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)] are linked to flow boundary conditions imposed by the scrape-off layer (SOL). Ballooning-like transport drives flow along magnetic field lines from low- to high-field regions with toroidal direction dependent on upper/lower x-point balance; the toroidal rotation of the confined plasma responds, exhibiting a strong counter-current rotation when Bx{nabla}B points away from the x point. Increased auxiliary heating power (rf, no momentum input) leads to an L-H transition at approximately twice the edge electron pressure gradient when Bx{nabla}B points away. As gradients rise prior to the transition, toroidal rotation ramps toward the co-current direction; the H mode is seen when the counter-current rotation imposed by the SOL flow becomes compensated. Remarkably, L-H thresholds in lower-limited discharges are identical to lower x-point discharges; SOL flows are also found similar, suggesting a connection.}, number={5}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={LaBombard, B. and Rice, J.E. and Hubbard, A.E. and Hughes, J.W. and Greenwald, M. and Granetz, R.S. and Irby, J.H. and Lin, Y. and Lipschultz, B. and Marmar, E.S. and et al.}, year={2005}, month={May}}

  abstract={Extensive linear and non-linear gyrokinetic simulations and linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) analyses performed for JET hybrid discharges with improved confinement have shown that the large population of fast ions found in the plasma core under particular heating conditions has a strong impact on core microturbulence and edge MHD by reducing core ion heat fluxes and increasing pedestal pressure in a feedback mechanism. In the case of the ITER like wall, it is shown how this mechanism plays a decisive role for the transition to plasma regimes with improved confinement and it can explain the weak power degradation obtained in dedicated power scans. The mechanism is found to be highly dependent on plasma triangularity as it changes the balance between the improvement in the plasma core and the edge. The feedback mechanism can play a similar role in the ITER hybrid scenario as in the JET discharges analysed due to its high triangularity plasmas and the large amount of fast ions generated in the core by the heating systems and the alpha power.}

Ion-scale ( k θ ρ s   ∼  1.0) and multi-scale (up to k θ ρ e   ∼  0.8) gyrokinetic simulations are compared at different simulated mass ratios to investigate the fidelity of reduced electron mass ratio, multi-scale simulation through direct comparison with realistic mass ratio, multi-scale simulation. Detailed description of both the numerical setup and the turbulent scales required to obtain meaningful coupled ITG/TEM/ETG simulation is presented. Significant high-k driven (TEM/ETG) heat flux is found to exist at scales of approximately k θ ρ e   ∼  0.1 at all mass ratios but can only be obtained by simulation capturing turbulence up to k θ ρ e   ∼  1.0. At slightly reduced mass ratio, μ = 40.0, qualitative agreement with realistic mass simulation can be obtained in the studied discharge, consistent with intuition obtained from linear stability analysis. However, realistic electron mass is required for any robust quantitative comparison with experimental heat fluxes for the condition studied, as significant differences are observed at even slightly reduced electron mass ratio. The details of this numerical study are presented to provide a basis for future studies utilizing coupled ITG/TEM/ETG gyrokinetic simulation.}

  abstract={This letter reports on quasi-coherent (QC) modes observed in fluctuation spectra from Tore Supra and TEXTOR reflectometers. QC modes have characteristics in between coherent and broad-band fluctuations as they oscillate around a given frequency but have a wide spectrum. They are ballooned at the LFS midplane and appear usually on a frequency ranging from 30 to 120 kHz. In ohmic plasmas from both tokamaks, QC modes are detected only in linear ohmic confinement (LOC) regime and disappear in saturated ohmic confinement (SOC) regime. Linear simulations from Tore Supra predict that the LOC and SOC regimes are dominated by electron and ion modes respectively. Measurements of the perpendicular velocity of density fluctuations have been made from the top of TEXTOR by poloidal correlation reflectometry. They suggest that QC modes have a phase velocity ∼400 m s −1 higher in the electron diamagnetic direction than lower frequency fluctuations. Additionally, the onset of QC modes during electron cyclotron resonance heating has been observed in a Tore Supra region where turbulence is suspected to be driven by electron modes. These experimental results and instability calculations show a correlation between onsets of QC modes and predictions of trapped electron modes.}

  abstract={Measurements of plasma core impurity ion temperature and toroidal rotation are obtained during the current ramp-up phases of plasma discharges in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, by means of charge exchange recombination spectroscopy utilizing short neutral beam injected blips. The phenomenology of these profiles as the current is varied is presented. The observations are reported for both ohmically heated and electron cyclotron heating assisted ramps, with auxiliary heating applied both on-axis and off-axis. The evolution of global parameters is also reported. A comparison between ion and electron kinetic profiles evolution is made. Power balance analysis is performed to establish the local confinement properties and their evolution during the current ramp. Transport modelling of several cases with a theory-based model is carried out and a recipe, which involves edge-relevant parameters, is proposed to account for the transport in the outer plasma region. Finally, linear gyrokinetic calculations of dominant microinstabilities allow us to correlate the observed transport with the background turbulence regime.}

  abstract={The effects of poloidal asymmetries and heated minority species are shown to be necessary to accurately describe heavy impurity transport in present experiments in JET and ASDEX Upgrade. Plasma rotation, or any small background electrostatic field in the plasma, such as that generated by anisotropic external heating can generate strong poloidal density variation of heavy impurities. These asymmetries have recently been added to numerical tools describing both neoclassical and turbulent transport and can increase neoclassical tungsten transport by an order of magnitude. Modelling predictions of the steady-state two-dimensional tungsten impurity distribution are compared with tomography from soft x-ray diagnostics. The modelling identifies neoclassical transport enhanced by poloidal asymmetries as the dominant mechanism responsible for tungsten accumulation in the central core of the plasma. Depending on the bulk plasma profiles, turbulent diffusion and neoclassical temperature screening can prevent accumulation. Externally heated minority species can significantly enhance temperature screening in ICRH plasmas.}

In this work, which is focused on the pulsed device DEMO1, scenarios are studied from the point of view of core transport, to assess plasma performance and limitations due to core microinstabilities. The role of radiated power, aspect ratio, and height of temperature pedestal are assessed as they impact both core energy and particle transport. Open issues in this framework are also discussed.}

  abstract={Upgraded spectroscopic hardware and an improved impurity concentration calculation allow accurate determination of boron density in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. A database of boron measurements is compared to quasilinear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations including Coriolis and centrifugal rotational effects over a range of H-mode plasma regimes. The peaking of the measured boron profiles shows a strong anti-correlation with the plasma rotation gradient, via a relationship explained and reproduced by the theory. It is demonstrated that the rotodiffusive impurity flux driven by the rotation gradient is required for the modelling to reproduce the hollow boron profiles at higher rotation gradients. The nonlinear simulations validate the quasilinear approach, and, with the addition of perpendicular flow shear, demonstrate that each symmetry breaking mechanism that causes momentum transport also couples to rotodiffusion. At lower rotation gradients, the parallel compressive convection is required to match the most peaked boron profiles. The sensitivities of both datasets to possible errors is investigated, and quantitative agreement is found within the estimated uncertainties. The approach used can be considered a template for mitigating uncertainty in quantitative comparisons between simulation and experiment.}

  abstract={ITER operations require effective fuelling of the core plasma for conditions in which neutral dynamics through the scrape-off layer is expected to significantly affect the efficiency of gas penetration. On the basis of the previous analysis for stationary conditions, pellets are foreseen to provide core fuelling of high-Q DT scenarios. In this paper we present a modelling study of the gas fuelling efficiency in ITER providing an estimate of the maximum plasma density achievable with gas fuelling only in various DT reference scenarios. Dynamical integrated core-edge plasma simulations for various phases of ITER DT H-mode discharges have been carried out with the JINTRAC suite of codes. Simulations of the L-mode phase show that divertor detachment sets the maximum density achievable at the separatrix by deuterium-tritium gas fuelling. The maximum volume-average density is achieved for 15 MA/5.3 T and it is close to the requirement for stationary application of neutral beam injection heating at full power (16.5 MW per injector) and ion energy (1 MeV) compatible with acceptable shine-through loads on the first wall. The achievable density in gas fuelled H-modes is typically a factor of 2–3 larger than in L-modes. The fusion performance of gas fuelled H-modes at 15 MA is typically found to be moderately high ( Q ~ 6–8). Sensitivity of the above predictions to modelling assumptions and validation of the physics models are discussed.}
